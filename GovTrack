      <description>                &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5371"&gt;current continuing resolution&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps the government funded, ends this Friday, January 30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It passed in November and ended the last shutdown. In addition to passage of the continuing resolution, some regular appropriations were also passed at the same time. It &lt;a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/section_by_section_for_continuing_resolution_and_extensions_divisions.pdf"&gt;included funding for the remainder of the fiscal year&lt;/a&gt; for the food assistance program SNAP, the Department of Agriculture, the FDA, military construction, Veterans Affairs, and Congress itself (that is, through Sept. 30, 2026).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of Friday, January 23, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/570/2026-01-24_no-new-laws-this-week"&gt;the House had passed the remaining appropriations for fiscal year 2026&lt;/a&gt;. It appeared that the Senate would then pass those bills this week and government operations would go uninterrupted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, this past weekend, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti-timeline.html?unlocked_article_code=1.HFA.Dn2O.P9ePKp0F-Oy9&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;Department of Homeland Security agents killed yet another legal observer of their activities in Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. Alex Pretti's death brings &lt;a href="https://x.com/nbcnews/status/2015456105535516903?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;the number of DHS shootings since September to 12&lt;/a&gt;. Four of those shootings have been fatal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pretti's death seems to have been the last straw for Senate Democrats. Since Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/congress/republicans-wont-split-dhs-funding-bill-as-democrats-demand-showdown-more-likely"&gt;enough of them have said that they will not vote for more funding for the Department of Homeland Security as currently proposed&lt;/a&gt; that, unless Republicans find a way to compromise, the government will again be shut down, albeit only partially this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/congress/republicans-wont-split-dhs-funding-bill-as-democrats-demand-showdown-more-likely"&gt;Senate Republicans say they are unwilling to make any changes to the existing appropriations bills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if Republicans do compromise in some way, perhaps by rearranging the existing legislation to separate DHS funding from all the other agencies, there would still be a short partial shut down at the very least because &lt;a href="https://pressgallery.house.gov/schedules/2026-house-calendar"&gt;the House will not return to session before January 30&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, assuming for now that a shutdown occurs, what would that mean? Well, first of all, this time, no food support would be endangered and the VA would keep running because those agencies were among the ones whose full year appropriations were passed last November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might mean &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7148/text"&gt;interruption in agencies like the Department of State, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Housing and Labor&lt;/a&gt;. It might mean some interruptions in the Department of Defense, but like last time, the administration would be looking for ways to shuffle existing funds to continue paying military personnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It almost certainly will have little or no effect on the operations of DHS even though that's the agency at the center of the dispute. Why not? Because, like last the last time around, the White House will likely designate DHS as essential and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/17/dhs-ice-border-patrol-pay-government-shutdown-kristi-noem/86744506007/"&gt;look for workaround funding without regard to the legality of that funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Senate is, officially, in session from the end of the day today through the week. However, due to the big winter storm this past weekend, no votes are scheduled until tomorrow at least. There are &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2026/01/26"&gt;20 committee meetings&lt;/a&gt; this week, including one on Wednesday where &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/senate-event/337934?s=1&amp;amp;r=4"&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio is expected to testify about Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is unclear right now where things will go right now. Our colleagues at &lt;a href="https://firstbranchforecast.substack.com/p/ice-storm?r=1tzg0&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;The First Branch Forecast&lt;/a&gt; explain the political considerations that Democrats are mulling right now. They also provide a fascinating summary of why the Government Publishing Office was established: in short, private enterprise isn't always better or cheaper than public agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you all on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated January 27, 2026 to reflect that only military construction got funded for the full fiscal year in the current continuing resolution and that the funding packages up for a vote include funding for the Department of Defense.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <title>No New Laws This Week</title>

      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:35:41 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>                &lt;p&gt;The House held several votes this week, but none of the bills voted on have been to the Senate yet, so none are law yet. The Senate was out this past week. There were two procedurally interesting votes noted below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have updated this post to more accurately describe the differences between &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7147"&gt;H.R. 7147&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7148"&gt;H.R. 7148&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, we we failed to note that 7148 also contained provisions funding the Department of Homeland Security (just not Border Patrol or ICE). This has become relevant since, after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/24/us/minneapolis-shooting-alex-pretti-timeline.html?unlocked_article_code=1.HFA.Dn2O.P9ePKp0F-Oy9&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;the murder of Alex Pretti by DHS agents in Minneapolis yesterday, Saturday, January 24&lt;/a&gt;, a number of Senate Democrats have indicated they will not vote for any bill that includes DHS funding. Since both 7147 and 7148 contain DHS funding, if enough Democrats refuse to vote for both or if the Senate creates new versions which fully separate DHS from other agencies, then that would mean there would be a partial government shutdown because the House will not be in session again until after the continuing resolution expires this coming Friday, January 30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Votes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5764"&gt;H.R. 5764: AI for Main Street Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require small business development centers to assist small business concerns with the use of artificial intelligence, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h33"&gt;395-14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6359"&gt;H.R. 6359: Pregnant Students’ Rights Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require institutions of higher education to disseminate information on the rights of, and accommodations and resources for, students who intend to carry the pregnancy to term, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h47"&gt;217-211&lt;/a&gt;. As predicted in our preview, it got only a single Democratic vote from &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/henry_cuellar/400657"&gt;Rep. Cuellar (D-TX28)&lt;/a&gt;, the only Democratic representative who is publicly anti-abortion.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6945"&gt;H.R. 6945: Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow states to use Social Security grant funds for pregnancy centers. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center"&gt;These organizations are also known as crisis pregnancy centers and are explicitly anti-abortion&lt;/a&gt;. It passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h37"&gt;215-209&lt;/a&gt;; again with a vote in favor from Rep. Cuellar.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hjres140"&gt;H.J.Res. 140:&lt;/a&gt; Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to Public Land Order No. 7917 for Withdrawal of Federal Lands; Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, MN passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h38"&gt;214-208&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hconres68"&gt;H.Con.Res. 68: To direct the removal of United States Armed Forces from Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress&lt;/a&gt; failed because it tied &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h48"&gt;215-215&lt;/a&gt; and needed one more vote in favor to pass.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7147"&gt;H.R. 7147: Making further consolidated appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2026&lt;/a&gt;, which covered appropriations for the portions of the Department of Homeland Security that include Border Patrol and ICE, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h42"&gt;220-207&lt;/a&gt;. Seven Democrats who typically vote with Republicans on anything related to immigration also did so here. The outcome would likely have been the same even if the Democrats had not voted in favor because as many of the four Republicans as possible, including &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/wesley_hunt/456946"&gt;Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX38)&lt;/a&gt;, would have been brought to Washington, D.C. to vote to ensure passage. In fact, as we noted this time last week, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiny-majority-house-gop-leaders-tell-members-show-unless-life-death-rcna254119"&gt;Hunt says he'll be there to vote when needed&lt;/a&gt;. We'll also note again that we think Hunt should be doing the job he currently has as a matter of course and not as an occasional sideline while he's running for the Senate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7148"&gt;H.R. 7148: Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr7148/text"&gt;covers the rest of the unpassed appropriations for fiscal year 2026, including other sections of the Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h45"&gt;341-88&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/amendment/119/house-amendment/154"&gt;H.Amdt. 154 (Foxx) to H.Res. 1014:&lt;/a&gt; An amendment to repeal section 213 of title II of Division C of the Continuing Appropriations, Agriculture, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Extensions Act, 2026, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h40"&gt;427-0&lt;/a&gt;. It's a bit hard to tell from looking at the bare legislation, but this amendment stripped a provision added to the current continuing appropriations bill passed to end the shutdown last year and allowed a small number of Senators to sue for having had their phones seized in January 6 investigations. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/553/2025-11-14_the-shutdown-is-over"&gt;We discussed it in a post then&lt;/a&gt;. How the House procedure worked this week was like this: the amendment was actually to the &lt;em&gt;rule&lt;/em&gt; setting the parameters of debate on the appropriations bill. By agreeing to the rule, the House also agreed to attach this amendment to the bill. Thus, when H.R. 7148 (the item above) passed, this amendment was attached.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This coming week the Senate is back in session while the House is out. You can reasonably expect that the Senate will vote on H.R. 7147 and 7148, the appropriations bills. They may vote on others passed this week, but the focus will be on avoiding another (even partial) shutdown as the current continuing appropriations run out Friday, January 30th.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <title>This Week: Senate Out, House In</title>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;The week of January 19, 2026, the Senate is out and the House is in. At the moment, things look relatively quiet in the House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/europe/2026/01/16/diplomatic-standoff-awaits-as-us-senators-fly-to-denmark-for-greenland-talks/"&gt;Many Senators are in Europe this week&lt;/a&gt; and will get to pretend they haven't heard of the President's latest justification for taking Greenland: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/19/trump-letter-norway-nobel-peace-greenland/88251326007/"&gt;that the Nobel Peace Prize Committee did not choose him&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There will be &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2026/01/19"&gt;31 House committee meetings this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There will be the now-usual mix of &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;mostly bills on suspension&lt;/a&gt; and a small number of bills to be voted on pursuant to a rule. The difference between the two categories is that bills on suspension need a 2/3rds majority to pass while bills coming through the Rules Committee need only a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week's Rules bills will likely only just get a simple majority as they are highly partisan:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6945"&gt;H.R. 6945: Supporting Pregnant and Parenting Women and Families Act&lt;/a&gt; would allow states to use Social Security grant funds for pregnancy centers. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_pregnancy_center"&gt;These organizations are also known as crisis pregnancy centers and are explicitly anti-abortion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6359"&gt;H.R. 6359: Pregnant Students’ Rights Act&lt;/a&gt; would require institutions of higher education to disseminate information on the rights of, and accommodations and resources for, students who intend to carry the pregnancy to term.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hjres140"&gt;H.J.Res. 140:&lt;/a&gt; Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to Public Land Order No. 7917 for Withdrawal of Federal Lands; Cook, Lake, and Saint Louis Counties, MN&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;h2&gt;Old Business, aka the Difficult Stuff&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least, these issues are difficult politically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epstein File Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law Congress passed and that the President signed required that all of the Department of Justice's files (excluding some that identified victims) were to be released by December 19, 2025. It's January 16, 2026 and the Department of Justice remains in violation of the law and &lt;a href="https://x.com/macfarlanenews/status/2012152312110920092?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;will for the foreseeable future according to their own court filings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Insurance Premium Subsidies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House did pass a resolution last week &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h11"&gt;extending the subsidies for three years&lt;/a&gt;. However, the House used an existing bill on a different topic with substituted language to get the job done. When the Clerk of the House sent the bill to the Senate, &lt;a href="https://jamiedupree.substack.com/p/oops-the-house-sent-the-wrong-obamacare"&gt;they sent the wrong version&lt;/a&gt;. If the Senate had been near an agreement on an amended replacement to the House version, this might have been an issue. But &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/burgessev.bsky.social/post/3mcd3hrqb622f"&gt;the Senate isn't near such an agreement&lt;/a&gt;, so the procedures necessary to get the correct version to the Senate will probably not be rushed. End result: if your premiums went up in the New Year, they're going to stay up for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venezuela War Powers Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/s5"&gt;five Republicans voted with all Democrats&lt;/a&gt; on a procedural vote to advance a war powers resolution about Venezuela. In the intervening days, the President publicly castigated those Republicans and privately lobbied them to change sides when the measure came up for a vote for real or to support a different kind of procedural vote to make the whole thing go away. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-blocks-measure-restrict-venezuela-strikes-trump-flips-two-repub-rcna253836"&gt;Two of those Republicans&lt;/a&gt; did change their minds (&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joshua_hawley/412840"&gt;Sens. Josh Hawley (R-MO)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/todd_young/412428"&gt;Todd Young (R-IN)&lt;/a&gt;) and that, with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, was enough to allow &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/s9"&gt;51-50&lt;/a&gt; passage of a different kind of procedural vote that makes the whole thing go away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Even Narrower Republican Majority in the House&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between resignations, deaths, health issues and some legislators simply not showing up like &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/wesley_hunt/456946"&gt;Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX38&lt;/a&gt;, the Republican majority in the House gets ever narrower. Hunt is running for Senate and has simply stopped doing his current job as a Representative in order to campaign for the Senate. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/tiny-majority-house-gop-leaders-tell-members-show-unless-life-death-rcna254119"&gt;He says he'll return to Washington when he's needed&lt;/a&gt;, but a) that's not always predictable and b) he still has a job for which he's being paid and it would be nice if he would, you know, do it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We'd provide a count of the margin that Republicans have to work with, except it changes constantly due to not only which Republicans are present, but also which Democrats. At the moment, the Republicans are down four members for sure: Rep. Greene resigned; Rep. LaMalfa died recently, and Reps.

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;If you’ve watched Law &amp;amp; Order, you know the stories are each divided between the police investigation and the district attorney’s prosecution. Well, for legislators in the House of Representatives, it’s more the police on one hand and the House Committee on Ethics (HCE) on the other. Dun dun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A bipartisan committee, but politics in practice&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Law enforcement, both local and federal, investigate alleged violations of the law. The HCE investigates violations of House Rules. Some things are violations of both laws and House Rules so a representative might get investigated both by law enforcement and HCE. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/henry_cuellar/400657"&gt;Rep. Cuellar was indicted by federal prosecutors in 2024 for allegedly accepting bribes&lt;/a&gt;. The HCE also opened an investigation. Last year &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardon-cuellar-45a47bc329bec820cd19c087b20fca19"&gt;he was pardoned by President Trump&lt;/a&gt;. So is he free of all concerns now? Probably, but not necessarily. While the legal case is over, the HCE can still investigate the allegations of bribery and censure, and even recommend to expel him, because bribery is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; against House Rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did this dual structure come to be?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript"&gt;Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution&lt;/a&gt; says&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only expulsion has any detail to it and that’s that it requires a 2/3rd majority. Otherwise, &lt;a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Origins-Development/Discipline/"&gt;the House has a range of punishments that have evolved over time&lt;/a&gt; to include censure - where not only does a majority vote to agree to a resolution of censure, but the censured member has to come down into the well of the House Floor while the resolution is read - but also reprimand/disapproval in which a majority of the House votes to agree to a resolution of reprimand/disapproval (but the member isn’t called down front to be shamed) and then a range of lesser public indications of “this was bad behavior”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until a &lt;a href="https://ethics.house.gov/committee-history/"&gt;standing committee to handle ethical or criminal allegations was created in the 1960s&lt;/a&gt;, reviews of and votes on censures or reprimands were handled by the whole House. With the establishment of the House Committee on Ethics (HCE), concerns were moved to the small group to investigate and then recommend action to the House as a whole. The HCE has an equal number of members from both the majority and minority parties in the House with the chair coming from the majority party. Most actions require a majority vote, or in other words, require members from both parties to vote in favor of them. In theory, this keeps the HCE from being purely a vehicle for political punishment. Again, in theory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2008, the &lt;a href="https://conduct.house.gov/about"&gt;Office of Congressional Conduct&lt;/a&gt; (OCC, originally the Office of Congressional Ethics) was established as an independent and non-partisan office, staffed by career civil servants rather than elected politicians, to handle allegations of misconduct and then make recommendations to the HCE on how or whether to proceed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why was the OCC created? Because of the pervasive belief that investigations of legislators were based solely on political goals despite its attempt to avoid this problem in its design. In theory then, an allegation would come to the OCC, they’d investigate to see if there was anything to it and, if so, recommend that HCE use their work to decide how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s just one problem: &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; ethics investigations are political because Congress is an inherently political body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s never a case when choosing to investigate a specific legislator’s actions, where the member is in either the majority or minority, won’t have political ramifications. So, when a legislator under investigation complains that they’re being attacked for politics, they’re not wrong, but it’s also not necessarily exculpatory because they may have indeed also broken laws or violated House rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take the recent example of former &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/george_santos/456921"&gt;Rep. George Santos&lt;/a&gt;. As soon as he won his election, stories began to appear in the press indicating that he had lied outrageously about a wide range of things in order to get elected. It soon became clear there was evidence that he had also committed a number of &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ex-congressman-george-santos-sentenced-87-months-prison-wire-fraud-and-aggravated"&gt;criminal campaign finance violations&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, there was a lot of pressure within the House to expel him. But, at that time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/118th_United_States_Congress"&gt;the Republicans held a very narrow majority in Congress&lt;/a&gt;. So as much as he could &lt;a href="https://ethics.house.gov/code-of-official-conduct/"&gt;creditably be said to bring disrepute on the House just by being there&lt;/a&gt; and there were &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/more-republicans-call-for-scandal-plagued-congressman-george-santos-to-resign"&gt;vocal objections to his presence from members of his own party&lt;/a&gt;, there was a political problem for the Republicans because they needed every vote they could get. Do they let the criminal process play out and keep him as a voting member? Or do they acknowledge his many violations of House rules in addition to criminal codes and take the high road? After nearly a year in Congress, the House chose to expel Santos. He was subsequently tried, convicted, served a few months in prison and then released when &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/20/nx-s1-5579580/trump-commuted-the-prison-sentence-of-george-santos-a-look-at-how-it-happened"&gt;President Trump commuted his sentence&lt;/a&gt;. This was an unusually obvious case of unethical behavior and even so, political considerations were never not part of the equation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Censures for speech&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last few years though, there’s been a new trend in censures that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; all politics. Legislators are not accused of violating anything other than the rule that requires them to bring credit to the House. However, the definition of discrediting the House has been filtered through partisan lenses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first instance of this new use of censure came in 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/adam_schiff/400361"&gt;Former Rep. Schiff&lt;/a&gt; (now a California Senator) was &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2023/h283"&gt;censured by the House of Representatives 213-209&lt;/a&gt; on June 21, 2023 for various statements and misstatements he made between 2017-2019 related to President Trump and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign — all likely protected from criminal prosecution by the First Amendment, but not protected from a House censure. The censure resolution itself contained misstatements including denying that the 2016 Trump Campaign attempted to coordinate with Russia, which was well documented by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/politics/read-the-mueller-report/"&gt;the Mueller Report&lt;/a&gt;. There was no campaign finance issue, no sexual harassment, no financial crime or other corruption alleged. He was censured because the Republican majority was angry about things he had &lt;em&gt;said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the real first instance of this was when the House voted to remove (now-&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-resign-in-january"&gt;former&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/marjorie_greene/456814"&gt;Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/04/963785609/house-to-vote-on-stripping-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-from-2-key-committees"&gt;her committees in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t a censure, but it was an effort to punish her for being a conspiracy theorist whose antics were, say it with me, bringing discredit to the House. 11 Republicans voted with all Democrats on that vote which was an unusual outcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then these censures over speech have passed the House:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Nov. 2023, Rep. Tlaib was &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2023/h622"&gt;censured 234-188&lt;/a&gt; for, according to the censure resolution, promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel. Tlaib and a number of Democratic colleagues denied that anything she said amounted to the allegations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the President's Joint Address to Congress on March 4 2025, Rep. Green repeatedly objected to various statements by President Trump. He was removed from the chamber and on March 6, he was censured &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h62"&gt;224-198&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the last few months there have been attempts to censure &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/lamonica_mciver/456962"&gt;Rep. McIver&lt;/a&gt; for having been charged with impeding law enforcement in a complicated situation at an ICE facility in New Jersey and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/stacey_plaskett/412659"&gt;Del. Plaskett&lt;/a&gt; for texting with Jeffrey Epstein during a Congressional hearing. In both cases, just enough Republicans voted with Democrats to table the censure resolutions that they failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Did McIver and Plaskett deserve the censures? For the most part, your answer will depend on which party you identify with - that’s certainly the case with House membership. Did McIver’s scuffle with ICE agents bring disrepute on the House? Not if you think that she was right in her efforts to defend Newark’s mayor Ras Baraka from what the Department of Justice later admitted was a wrongful arrest. Does Plaskett texting with Epstein bring disrepute on the House? Apparently not in the minds of most Democratic members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Campaign finance violations, misusing his office and sexual assault and stalking: The cases of Rep. Cory Mills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also in both cases, Democrats used the threat of a censure over allegations against Republican &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/cory_mills/456889"&gt;Rep. Cory Mills&lt;/a&gt; to successfully kill the resolutions against Democrats McIver and Plaskett. Was the threat against Mills what pushed those Republicans to vote to table? They didn’t say so, but it might have been.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something that is frustrating for regular observers of Congress is that the allegations against Mills are much more serious than any brought against either McIver or Plaskett. He is variously accused of multiple campaign finance violations, misusing his office and sexual assault and stalking. Yet, these allegations were treated purely as political tools. He should have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; been under investigation by the Ethics Committee for all of them (he had been investigation for a small fraction for about a year already). Instead, Democrats appeared to only take the allegations as seriously as they needed to protect their own members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ironically, as the last vote in a 3 censure/censure-like vote week, a censure resolution against Mills, brought by fellow Republican &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/nancy_mace/456843"&gt;Rep. Nancy Mace&lt;/a&gt;, was diverted into a recommendation that HCE investigate Mills on all the listed allegations. They say &lt;a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-of-the-chairman-and-ranking-member-of-the-committee-on-ethics-regarding-representative-cory-mills-2/"&gt;they have begun that process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Serve or resign&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except for George Santos, and Greene who resigned for unrelated reasons, everyone mentioned so far in this post is still serving either in the House or in the Senate. Most still have their committee memberships and have faced no further consequences. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth is, no matter what a legislator says about Congress, they generally &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to be there and will work to stay in Congress. Likely the one true punishment for a legislator is being either expelled or voted out in the next election. If you look through our &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/misconduct"&gt;Misconduct Database&lt;/a&gt;, you can find lots of examples where legislators were being investigated and, while there was no specific action taken by the Ethics Committee or law enforcement against them, they also chose not to run again or lost in primaries. Recent examples include: &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/michael_mccaul/400654"&gt;Rep. Michael McCaul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/jamaal_bowman/456839"&gt;Rep. Jamaal Bowman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/madison_cawthorn/456833"&gt;Rep. Madison Cawthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kaialii_kahele/456815"&gt;Rep. Kaialiʻi Kahele&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/carolyn_maloney/400251"&gt;Rep. Carolyn Maloney&lt;/a&gt;. There were doubtless other factors that contributed to each of these legislators’ retirements/losses including redistricting, but it’s also possible (&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/us/politics/madison-cawthorn-loss.html"&gt;and certain in Cawthorn’s case&lt;/a&gt;) that the party ceased to provide support as did the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To recap, when a legislator’s behavior warrants punishment, the House has a number of mechanisms by which to do so. Traditionally, these efforts are reserved for violations of House Rules other than just bringing discredit to the House or for their speech. But, as Congress continues to be intensely partisan and very, very narrowly divided, that is changing and censures as purely political tools seem to be gaining ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Misconduct should have consequences&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a nascent effort by a bipartisan set of representatives to &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5616535-beyer-bacon-resolution-censure/"&gt;change the House Rules so that a censure requires a 60% vote&lt;/a&gt; rather than the current simple majority. This effort misses the point. No one else can punish House members for violations of House Rules besides the House itself. The problem isn’t the number of censures; it’s that the censures aren’t necessarily about actual misconduct. Making it easier for House members to violate House Rules looks like a step backwards. The rules aren’t the problem. The problem is that there’s so much political value to pursuing censures even when there’s no specific misconduct alleged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it is, HCE investigations can drag on for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt;. Rep. Mills, as we already noted, has been under investigation for a year already. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/sheila_cherfilus_mccormick/456865"&gt;Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick’s&lt;/a&gt; HCE investigation began in 2023 and is not yet concluded. Same for &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/troy_nehls/456848"&gt;Rep. Troy Nehls&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile investigations of &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/henry_cuellar/400657"&gt;Rep. Henry Cuellar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/andrew_ogles/456939"&gt;Rep. Andy Ogles&lt;/a&gt; began in 2024 and remain unresolved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House would be much better served by beefing up HCE and OCC and by pressuring legislators to cooperate with investigations rather than stonewalling them, and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; making it harder to discipline members.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;On January 30, 2026, the current continuing resolution ends. Not all of the remaining funding bills for the government have been passed so a partial shutdown could be on the way. There are three work weeks left in January.  But the House and Senate are only both in session this week. Senate is out next week, back last week of January; House the reverse. So, effectively, they've got this week to coordinate funding decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/11226-am/"&gt;Punchbowl&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Congress may look to fund the Department of Homeland Security with a continuing resolution for the rest of FY2026, according to multiple aides and lawmakers familiar with the planning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;GOP and Democratic negotiators tell us that the wave of protests against ICE nationwide following Wednesday’s fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis make it impossible for Congress to craft a spending bill that can get 60 votes in the Senate. Democrats want tough new restrictions on ICE and Republicans will resist."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be able to pass both chambers by January 30th? Maybe. A regular appropriations bill in which funding for DHS is increased? Much less likely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week the Senate also has to make a decision on whether to act at all and how they'll do so with respect to the three year extension of health insurance premium subsidies that the House passed last week &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h11"&gt;230-196&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2026/01/12"&gt;the usual rounds of committee meetings this week&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;an average number of bills coming to the House Floor&lt;/a&gt;. Two of these bills will, if passed by the House this week, become law:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s3424"&gt;S. 3424: Bankruptcy Administration Improvement Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt; which would increase bankruptcy case fees and extend terms of bankruptcy judges, and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s269"&gt;S. 269: Ending Improper Payments to Deceased People Act&lt;/a&gt; which, its sponsors claim, would decrease improper Social Security payments to dead people by increasing coordination between federal and state agencies. The impetus for this bill may have been false claims made earlier this year by Elon Musk and &lt;a href="https://crr.bc.edu/150-year-olds-arent-getting-social-security-heres-a-better-task-for-doge/"&gt;debunked by the Center for Retirement Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;This week was the beginning of the Second Session of the 119th Congress. This session will last until January 3, 2027.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There weren't a lot of votes this week, but while two indicated Congress standing up for its own powers a little, two others showed just how limited that effort is. No bills became law this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Venezuela War Powers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Senate held a procedural vote on &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/sjres98"&gt;a Joint Resolution to end hostilities with Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/s5"&gt;52-47&lt;/a&gt; due to support from five Republicans. The odds that the actual Joint Resolution passes the Senate next week have increased. The odds it ever passes the House have not increased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Health Insurance Premium Subsidies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House passed a three year extension of the health insurance premium subsidies that lapsed at the end of 2025 by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h11"&gt;230-196&lt;/a&gt;. Seventeen Republicans voted with all Democrats in this case. That's not a lot compared to the 196 who voted against, but it was unusual to get even this many Republicans to vote for anything related to Obamacare. The bill will go to the Senate next and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/in-a-rebuke-of-gop-leadership-house-heads-toward-vote-to-extend-health-care-subsidies"&gt;the expectation is that if it comes to the floor there, it will have been amended&lt;/a&gt;. The likelihood even an amended version passes in the Senate is unclear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;House Fails to Override Two Vetoes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, when he issued them, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-fails-override-trumps-vetoes-two-republican-bills-rcna252891"&gt;President Trump said&lt;/a&gt; cost concerns were behind his veto of the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, but the veto of the Miccosukee bill was due to their opposition to the Everglades detention center built last year. Both of these bills had been sponsored by Republicans in the House, so the vetoes were to the detriment to fellow Republicans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/vetoes/vetoCounts.htm"&gt;Veto overrides almost always fail&lt;/a&gt;. On the one hand, it's not surprising that this week's two override votes did too. On the other, the bills in question passed both chambers of Congress by voice vote (House) and unanimous consent (Senate) which generally means both chambers are overwhelmingly in favor of the bills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though successful overrides are rare, these are usually the kinds of circumstances that lead to that success. But not this time. This time, the House gave in to the President. Neither override vote met or exceeded the 2/3rds majority needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr504"&gt;H.R. 504: Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act&lt;/a&gt; failed to override the veto by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h8"&gt;236-188&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr131"&gt;H.R. 131: Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act&lt;/a&gt; failed to override the veto by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h9"&gt;248-177&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Funding the Government&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another funding bill is in the pipeline in advance of the January 30, 2026 end of the current continuing resolution funding the government. This bill, containing appropriations for multiple agencies, will still have to pass the Senate and it's expected to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6938"&gt;H.R. 6938: Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; and Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2026/h7"&gt;397-28&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;h2&gt;What has the U.S. done to Venezuela?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was it an invasion, law enforcement, or extortion? &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-u-s-military-escalation-against-venezuela-leading-to-maduros-capture"&gt;Since last fall&lt;/a&gt; we’ve&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;bombed small boats and their civilian Venezuelan crews that we have claimed were smuggling drugs to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brought a fleet of military vessels to the region&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dropped bombs near Caracas, the capital of Venezuela&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seized President Maduro and his wife and indicted him in federal court over drug trafficking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Announced a plan to seize some Venezuelan crude oil &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/oil-sales-from-venezuela-to-continue-indefinitely-sanctions-will-be-reduced-source-says.html"&gt;indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; and spend it at the President’s discretion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether any of this was legal is a difficult and a somewhat philosophical question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is the War Powers Resolution?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The War Powers Resolution, a 1973 law,, “requires that the President communicate to Congress the committal of troops within 48 hours. Further, the statute requires the President to remove all troops after 60 days if Congress has not granted an extension,” per the &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/war_powers"&gt;Legal Information Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Cornell University. Since military action appears to be over, although the President has threatened further action around the world, the War Powers Resolution may have been satisfied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs)?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Constitution gives the power to declare war to Congress, not the President, but all recent presidents have engaged in military actions without declaring war. In most cases, it came with an authorization from Congress instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a href="http://congress.gov"&gt;Congress.gov&lt;/a&gt;, AUMFs are laws which “permit the President to use United States military forces in pursuit of set objectives and within defined parameters.” Without an AUMF, the President must rely on inherent Constitutional powers of the presidency, which may or may not apply. For example, after the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress passed an AUMF that was used as the legal basis for military force in a wide range of places around the world because the authorization was for military force against terrorists. That authorization, along with one from 1991, were both repealed in the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. President Trump signed that law last year about a week before he attacked Venezuela and captured the Venezuelan president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether removing a head of state is tantamount to declaring war, and thus not permitted without Congress’s approval, is not likely to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Are we bound by international law?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, we agreed to be bound by international law when we joined the United Nations, of which we are still a member. In general, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/was-us-capture-venezuelas-president-legal-2026-01-03/"&gt;UN members are prohibited from unilaterally using force against other nations, with very few exceptions&lt;/a&gt;. This is the point of having an entity like the UN - to help manage disputes in order to avoid or at least decrease violent conflict around the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, who’s going to stop us if we ignore international law?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can the President control the proceeds from selling Venezuelan oil?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Constitution is very direct in giving Congress ultimate control over government spending: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” Trump’s social media post that the “money will be controlled by me” makes a big assumption that Congress writes him a blank check in law first. Currently, many members of Congress are going on the record saying that &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/07/congress/congress-venezuelan-oil-revenue-oversight-00714107?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=bluesky"&gt;they want oversight over any US revenues from Venezuelan oil sales&lt;/a&gt;, side-stepping the Constitutional issue of how the revenue is spent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What Might Congress Do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/house/congress-swamped/"&gt;the Senate will vote on a War Powers bill to stop President Trump’s actions in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not expected to pass, and certainly not with enough votes to override the President’s veto. Democrats might also withhold votes on upcoming government funding bills, triggering another government shutdown at the end of the month, unless military funding is restricted or to extract other policy concessions around Venezuela and the sale of its oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or Congress could pass legislation &lt;em&gt;affirming&lt;/em&gt; the administration’s actions, instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is Congress Likely to Do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing. It’s the safest choice politically. If you come out too strongly for or against and then public attitudes about the Administration’s actions go heavily one way or the other, it’ll cost votes. So the best thing to do politically is often nothing.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;Today, January 5, 2026, marks the first day of the second session of the 119th Congress. Between unresolved legislation from last year and the Administration's attack on Venezuela this weekend, both chambers appear to be making minimal firm plans to allow for changes over the course of the week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Senate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some point this week, the Senate will vote on &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/04/schumer-senate-venezuela-authorization-vote-00710205"&gt;a resolution that would prohibit the Trump Administration from further attacks on Venezuela&lt;/a&gt;. It will likely fail since the measure, sponsored by Democrats, would need four Republicans to vote with them and so far only &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/rand_paul/412492"&gt;Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)&lt;/a&gt; has indicated support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;House&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House has scheduled, pursuant to action in the Rules Committee, votes on two bills:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4593"&gt;H.R. 4593: SHOWER Act&lt;/a&gt; which would undo some conservation regulations on shower heads.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5184"&gt;H.R. 5184: Affordable HOMES Act&lt;/a&gt; which would make manufactured homes less energy efficient.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House may vote on &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres780"&gt;H.Res. 780&lt;/a&gt;: Providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 1834) to advance policy priorities that will break the gridlock which, title notwithstanding, would set in motion a vote to extend the now expired health insurance subsidies. This bill is coming to the floor via discharge petition. All Democrats and four Republicans cosponsored it. If all the cosponsors vote for it, it will pass the House. Conventional wisdom is that it would then be amended in the Senate to be a little closer to the preferences of the majority of Republicans in the House and Senate and then come back to the House. This path seems fairly likely given that Senate Majority Leader Thune is now saying that he's &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakesherman/status/2008167602095329318?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;"not averse"&lt;/a&gt; to such a compromise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Committee Meetings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, between both the House and Senate, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2026/01/05"&gt;there are 13 committee meetings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what's all the unscheduled time for? Apparently learning more about what exactly it is that we have done so far in Venezeula as well as what the Administration intends to do going forward.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;The media loves to tell you your government isn't working, even when it is. Don't let anyone tell you 2025 was an unproductive year for Congress. [Edit: To clarify, I don't mean the government is working for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1,976 pages of new law&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 1,976 pages of new law enacted since President Trump took office, including an &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/506/2025-05-23_house-passes-1100-page-spending-and-tax-bill-raising-debt-by-up-to-4-trillion"&gt;increase of the national debt limit by $4 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, any journalist telling you not much happened in Congress this year is sleeping on the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using rules that exempt certain bills from the filibuster, Congress passed (and President Trump signed into law) the 330-page "reconciliation" bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/518/2025-07-03_reconciliation-bill-to-be-signed-on-july-4"&gt;which included&lt;/a&gt; tax breaks adding $500 billion to the deficit; new limits on Medicaid, SNAP, federal student loads, and green energy; and $171 billion for immigration enforcement, making ICE the largest law enforcement agency in the United States. Also exempt from the filibuster was the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/511/2025-06-13_rescissions-bill-irs-confirmation"&gt;"rescissions" bill&lt;/a&gt; which slashed most funding for foreign aid (&lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/hr4_Rescissions_Act_of_2025.pdf"&gt;saving about $800 million&lt;/a&gt; and potentially causing &lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/update-lives-lost-usaid-cuts"&gt;1 million deaths world-wide&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2025-07-14/china-steps-in-as-us-pulls-back-from-diplomacy-report-says"&gt;geopolitical vacuum that China is ready to fill&lt;/a&gt;) and public broadcasting &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/hr4_Rescissions_Act_of_2025.pdf"&gt;(saving about $100 million)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those were perhaps the most controversial bills ever enacted, with senators voting yes on the reconciliation bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s372"&gt;representing just 44% of the country's population&lt;/a&gt;. I don't think that's ever happened before and really captures the political climate. (For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/s396"&gt;Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. Obamacare, passed the Senate with the yea votes representing 62% of the country’s population.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Congress passed the 1,259-page National Defense Authorization Act, a yearly bill that sets military and related policies. This year, the NDAA incorporated &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s1071"&gt;40 other bills&lt;/a&gt; on a range of topics, including &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s1595"&gt;police first aid kits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s555"&gt;reuniting Korean American families with family members in North Korea&lt;/a&gt;. It also included a provision intended &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/559/2025-12-12_congress-just-barely-stands-up-for-itself"&gt;to force the Secretary of Defense to provide more information on the military strikes on Venezuelan civilian boats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using a rarely-used rule to override the Speaker of the House, legislators passed the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hres581/text"&gt;Epstein Files Transparency Act&lt;/a&gt; to force the Trump Administration to release Epstein files. It's incredibly significant any time the Speaker loses control over the floor since setting the floor schedule is the Speaker's most important job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress also quashed numerous Biden Administration regulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the Senate &lt;a href="https://ourpublicservice.org/performance-measures/political-appointee-tracker/"&gt;confirmed 341 Trump nominees&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fairly fast pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;196 bills enacted&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sort=-current_status_date#enacted_ex=on"&gt;196 bills were enacted.&lt;/a&gt; The mainstream media will tell you it's only 61 because they don't look at what's inside omnibus bills. Fewer bills are getting a vote and presidential signature, but they are getting longer and longer and often bundle a number of other bills. (That's a trend that started decades ago.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 1,976 pages Trump signed into law is on the low side: More than Reagan (1,528) and GW Bush (1,024) did by this point in their terms, less than the first Bush (2,518), Clinton (2,705), Obama (3,478), Trump in his first term (2,236), and Biden (2,450).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But more isn't better, and not every page of legislation enacted is actually important.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reverse is also true. The just &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4/text"&gt;two pages&lt;/a&gt; cutting foreign aid has enormous domestic and geopolitical consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What Congress hasn't done&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's also true that there are things that Congress hasn't done. Like &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/553/2025-11-14_the-shutdown-is-over"&gt;not being in session&lt;/a&gt;. House Republicans took their chamber out of session for some 40 days vowing to not negotiate with Democrats to end October's government shutdown, only to come back into session to approve a bill negotiated with Democrats in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They could have used that time to figure out agency funding levels for the remainder of the fiscal year after January. Instead, another government shutdown may be around the corner. (Congress is supposed to have figured this out before the fiscal year began on October 1.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor has Congress done much for government efficiency, allowing Trump to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/23/us/politics/doge-musk-trump-analysis.html"&gt;fabricate cuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/federal-newscast/2025/05/new-data-shows-collective-impact-of-19-fired-igs/"&gt;fire Inspectors General&lt;/a&gt;, the abuse watchdogs at federal agencies. Republicans also hope to &lt;a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/agency-oversight/2025/06/gao-faces-nearly-50-budget-cut-less-oversight-of-withheld-funds-in-budget-plan/"&gt;downsize Congress's abuse investigators&lt;/a&gt; at the Government Accountability Office. These cuts would cost taxpayers billions of dollars by allowing waste, fraud, and abuse to go unchecked. Or more likely, abuse would be checked just when it advances the President's interests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress has also been silent on Trump's tariffs, despite &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/519/2025-07-07_trumps-tariffs-are-unlawful-how-the-nondelegation-doctrine-limits-congress"&gt;the power to tariff being reserved to Congress&lt;/a&gt;. Congress could also address the Trump Administration's illegal deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, or the swirling conflicts of interest in the Trump family.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <title>Congress Passes Laws; Trump Administration Ignores Some of Them</title>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;One characteristic of the current Trump Administration has been a disregard for laws if they don't align with Administration goals. One of the most influential members of the Administration, both in terms of influence on Trump himself as well as control over the flow of funds from the government, is the Directer of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought. &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/russ-vought-trump-shadow-president-omb?utm_campaign=propublica-sprout&amp;amp;utm_content=1766116809&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;He said in 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t want President Trump having to lose a moment of time having fights in the Oval Office about whether something is legal or doable or moral.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, well, the Administration has not. Sometimes the choices are relatively trivial, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/work-begins-to-install-trumps-name-on-kennedy-center-building/4031850/"&gt;like adding Trump's name to the Kennedy Center&lt;/a&gt; even though the name is set by Congress and they haven't changed it. Sometimes, it's not trivial as in the case of the various strikes on boats in the Caribbean. Even if one finds &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/18/politics/venezuela-boat-strikes-trump"&gt;the Administration's various claims about shooting down boats&lt;/a&gt; persuasive, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-the-law-says-about-killing-survivors-of-a-boat-strike-according-to-experts"&gt;killing survivors of strikes is clearly illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many more examples of this approach but today we'll start with one of the more contentious issues the Trump Administration has faced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Epstein Files&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, December 19, 2025 is the day that all the Department of Justice files on Jeffrey Epstein were to be released. A month ago, both chambers passed the bill and then the President signed it. However, as of this morning, and in contravention of the text of the law, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/19/epstein-documents-release-friday-deadline-00699935"&gt;the Administration says it will only release some files today&lt;/a&gt; and the rest will be released as the Administration says they're ready.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Another Discharge Petition&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/centrist-republicans-revolt-signing-petition-force-vote-obamacare-fund-rcna249693"&gt;four House Republicans signed onto an otherwise entirely Democratic discharge petition&lt;/a&gt; to force the House to hold a vote on extending the subsidies for health insurance premiums for people who get their health insurance via the Obamacare Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/robertscotthorton.bsky.social/post/3maadzujiw22d"&gt;Speaker Johnson adjourned the House a day early to ensure the vote would not take place before the subsidies end&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/18/affordable-care-act-subsidies-expire/"&gt;premium costs would rise for millions of people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because it's a discharge petition, the bill &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; get a vote. Just not until January. If it passes though, it will still have to get through the Senate. It's &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/12/17/congress/problem-solvers-meeting-obamacare-00695105"&gt;very likely that the Senate would amend the bill in some way&lt;/a&gt; and send it back to the House. So whether the subsidies get extended after all remains very much up in the air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Laws&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s222"&gt;S. 222: Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt; passed by voice vote.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s284"&gt;S. 284: Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act&lt;/a&gt; passed by voice vote.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s216"&gt;S. 216: Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act&lt;/a&gt; passed by voice vote.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s2878"&gt;S. 2878: Great Lakes Fishery Research Reauthorization Act&lt;/a&gt; passed by voice vote.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s284"&gt;S. 284: Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act &lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h335"&gt;370-22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s1071"&gt;S. 1071: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2026&lt;/a&gt; passed the Senate by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s648"&gt;77-20&lt;/a&gt;. The NDAA includes &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/17/senate-ndaa-passage-trump-boat-strikes-00694738"&gt;a decrease in the Secretary of Defense's travel budget&lt;/a&gt; unless he releases full video of the various boat strikes this fall. &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hegseth-says-he-wont-publicly-release-video-of-boat-strike-that-killed-survivors-in-the-caribbean"&gt;The Secretary of Defense says he will not release the videos&lt;/a&gt;, so will the Administration stay within the authorized travel budget?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bills Passed in the House Only&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the bills below will have to pass the Senate before they become law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3187"&gt;H.R. 3187: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to convey a parcel of property of the Forest Service to Perry County, Arkansas, and for other purposes&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h336"&gt;388-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4371"&gt;H.R. 4371: Kayla Hamilton Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/delos/newsletter/2025-12-19/hr-4371-kayla-hamilton-immigrant-minors-detention-house-senate"&gt;invasive exams of children for tattoos or gang-related markings&lt;/a&gt;, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h340"&gt;225-201&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3616"&gt;H.R. 3616: Reliable Power Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require assessments of new plans for reliability, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h347"&gt;225-203&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3632"&gt;H.R. 3632: Power Plant Reliability Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, which would require assessments of plants or components to be retired, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h342"&gt;222-202&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4776"&gt;H.R. 4776: SPEED Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would speed up energy project approvals passed, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5655328-house-bill-to-speed-act-energy-projects/"&gt;but only after an anti-wind power amendment was added&lt;/a&gt;, by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h356"&gt;221-196&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1366"&gt;H.R. 1366: Mining Regulatory Clarity Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would &lt;a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2025/12/19/public-land-mining-bill-passes-house-amodei/87837798007/"&gt;override a 2022 court decision and restore mining rules in effect before that decision&lt;/a&gt;, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h358"&gt;219-198&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bills below, all of which received a vote, passed with fewer votes overall in support than the ACA health insurance premium subsidies discharge petition has. Why did they come to the floor? Well, because these bills are primarily supported by Republicans while the ACA one is not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr6703"&gt;H.R. 6703: Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act &lt;/a&gt;, which includes a number of provisions intended to lower premium costs, but does not include an extension of the subsidies in contention, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h349"&gt;216-211&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3492"&gt;H.R. 3492: Protect Children’s Innocence Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would criminalize gender affirming health care for minors, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h351"&gt;216-211&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr498"&gt;H.R. 498: Do No Harm in Medicaid Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would ban gender affirming health care for minors receiving Medicaid, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h362"&gt;215-201&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr845"&gt;H.R. 845: Pet and Livestock Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species list, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h360"&gt;211-204&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Realities of Trying to Get a Bill Passed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bulwark published a story today about &lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/pediatric-cancer-bill-bernie-sanders-mikaela-naylon"&gt;the realities of trying to get a pediatric cancer bill passed&lt;/a&gt;. It highlights a basic question that legislators face all the time: when is a bill good enough to warrant a vote in support? What if opposing the bill now sets up that bill plus others that are also important to the legislator for passage later? What if that bet turns out to be wrong and none of the bills ever get passed? Highly recommended read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress will not return until after New Years, so you probably won't hear from us either until then. We hope any holidays you already are celebrating or plan to celebrate soon are joyful and we'll see you in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;This week, December 15 through December 19, is the last one that Congress will work this year despite multiple unusually lengthy breaks already throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will they be working on?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Senate focuses on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week the Senate will attempt to pass the revised version of the NDAA that passed the House last week. In addition to the details provided in last week's &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/558/2025-12-08_mostly-this-week-is-about-the-national-defense-authorization-act"&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/559/2025-12-12_congress-just-barely-stands-up-for-itself"&gt;recap&lt;/a&gt;, the NDAA also &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jbendery.bsky.social/post/3m7xexyjpsc2d"&gt;includes federal recognition for the Lumbee Tribe&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/lumbee-tribe-big-win-trump_n_693c4725e4b07bcd25437578"&gt;no other tribal bills made it into the NDAA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2025/12/15/this-week-congress-has-much-to-do-before-holiday-recess/"&gt;According to Roll Call&lt;/a&gt;, there may be some effort to amend the NDAA further with provisions on flight management at Reagan National Airport. The Senate will also, as is usual, attempt to confirm a host of nominations and &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/index.php/committee-schedule/weekly/2025/12/15?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22%7D"&gt;hold 10 hearings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;House&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House has &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;20 bills that will come to the floor on suspension of the rules&lt;/a&gt; since they're expected to gather the necessary 2/3rds majority easily. Four of them will become law if they're passed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s222"&gt;S. 222: Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow schools participating in the school lunch program to serve whole milk.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s284"&gt;S. 284: Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s216"&gt;S. 216: Save Our Seas 2.0 Amendments Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would amend the Save Our Seas 2.0 Act to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Foundation, to amend the Marine Debris Act to improve the administration of the Marine Debris Program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s2878"&gt;S. 2878: Great Lakes Fishery Research Reauthorization Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would  reauthorize funding to monitor, assess, and research the Great Lakes Basin.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;Nine bills&lt;/a&gt; will come to the floor via a rule if they make it out of the Rules Committee hearings this week. The &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/house-event/118777?s=4&amp;amp;r=2"&gt;first meeting is Monday, December 15&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/house-event/118783?s=1&amp;amp;r=13"&gt;second meeting is Tuesday, December 16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of particular note are these four bills:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20251215/FILE_3948.pdf"&gt;H.R. __ – Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act &lt;/a&gt; for which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/15/politics/gop-health-care-new-bill-house"&gt;CNN provides some detail&lt;/a&gt;. (The bill is currently unnumbered and in neither Congress.gov nor Govtrack.us)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr845"&gt;H.R. 845: Pet and Livestock Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; which would remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr498"&gt;H.R. 498: Do No Harm in Medicaid Act&lt;/a&gt;, which bans all gender affirming health care for minors receiving Medicaid. It does not criminalize gender affirming health care or prevent it for minors covered under private insurance.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3492"&gt;H.R. 3492: Protect Children’s Innocence Act&lt;/a&gt;, which bans all gender affirming health care for minors and criminalizes such health care by providing for jail time for doctors who provide it and anyone who assists, such as providing transportation across state lines. This bill is sponsored by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/marjorie_greene/456814"&gt;soon-to-be former Rep. Greene (R-GA14)&lt;/a&gt;. If it passes the House, the vote will be very close. However, neither it nor the preceding three bills will become law unless they pass the Senate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you all on Friday for the recap to see what actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;A theme this week has been some very mild resistance to the Trump Administration from Congressional Republicans. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) did pass, but it contained some minor constraints against the Administration while House Republicans, via discharge petition, voted to nullify a Trump Executive Order on federal employee bargaining rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;NDAA&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having now passed the House &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h320"&gt;312-112&lt;/a&gt;, this bill will go back to the Senate for passage again because of amendments made to the House version. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/558/2025-12-08_mostly-this-week-is-about-the-national-defense-authorization-act"&gt;what we highlighted in our preview on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, the NDAA &lt;a href="https://x.com/craigcaplan/status/1998732808546566176?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;increased military pay and repealed the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force against Iraq&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/defense-policy-bill-includes-provision-limiting-defense-secretarys-tra-rcna248117"&gt;Minor cuts to Secretary of Defense Hegseth's travel budget are included&lt;/a&gt; unless unedited video of military strikes on civilian boats are released. Lastly, quite a few Democrats voted in favor of the the NDAA. Why? Well, according to House Armed Services Committee member &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/adam_smith/400379"&gt;Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA9)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/hascdemocrats/status/1998141681267339634?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;there were enough wins or draws to make it worthwhile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Federal Employee Bargaining Rights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The increasingly common discharge petition was used again to bring the bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr2550"&gt;H.R. 2550: Protect America’s Workforce Act&lt;/a&gt; to the House floor. The bill, which would nullify a Trump Executive Order stripping bargaining rights from federal employees, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h332"&gt;231-195&lt;/a&gt;. This vote was notable for the &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/congress/house-republicans-overturn-trump-order-collective-bargaining-federal-workers"&gt;20 Republicans who voted in favor&lt;/a&gt;. It still has to pass the Senate before it would become law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Will Become Law&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s356"&gt;S. 356: Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, which would reauthorize programs that provide funding that support local government services like education to counties with National Forest System land administered by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h315"&gt;399-5&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.naco.org/news/congress-passes-secure-rural-schools-reauthorization-act-2025-victory-counties"&gt;National Association of Counties provides more detail&lt;/a&gt;. It next goes to the President for signing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other Bills Passed in the House&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these bills will still need to pass the Senate, so they are not yet law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1676"&gt;H.R. 1676: Make SWAPs Efficient Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, which would make state wildlife action plans more efficient by requiring approval from the Secretary of the Interior within 180 days, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h316"&gt;400-0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3383"&gt;H.R. 3383: Increasing Investor Opportunities Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would amend the Investment Company Act of 1940 with respect to the authority of closed-end companies (&lt;a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/closed-end-funds"&gt;also known as closed-end funds&lt;/a&gt;) to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/resources-small-businesses/capital-raising-building-blocks/private-funds"&gt;private funds&lt;/a&gt;, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h328"&gt;302-123&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3638"&gt;H.R. 3638: Electric Supply Chain Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would direct the Secretary of Energy to prepare periodic assessments and submit reports on the supply chain for the generation and transmission of electricity, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h324"&gt;267-159&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3898"&gt;H.R. 3898: PERMIT Act&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/clean-water-act-permitting-bill-clears-the-house/"&gt;would make more than a dozen changes to the Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt;, including establishing new procedures to reduce lawsuits and limiting states’ authority to block infrastructure due to environmental concerns, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h330"&gt;221-205&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr3628"&gt;H.R. 3628: State Planning for Reliability and Affordability Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 to add a standard related to State consideration of reliable generation, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h323"&gt;218-207&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.quiverquant.com/news/Congress+Vote%3A+The+House+has+passed+H.R.+3628+-++State+Planning+for+Reliability+and+Affordability+Act"&gt;Quiver Quantitative provides some more information about the bill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;      </description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:01:34 +0000</pubDate>
      <description>                &lt;h2&gt;National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest iteration of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was released yesterday and it's going to take up most of the legislative attention this week, votes and committee meetings notwithstanding. Why? Because it's considered a "must-pass" bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens when a bill is considered one that must pass is that a whole lot gets stuffed into it. This year's authorization is no different. &lt;a href="https://x.com/jamiedupree/status/1997816135425634623?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;It is 3,086 pages&lt;/a&gt; and authorizes &lt;a href="https://x.com/briana_reilly/status/1997826285603815908?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;$900.6 billion in spending&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rcp_xml-2.pdf"&gt;The Rules Committee has posted the text&lt;/a&gt;. You might want to start with the summaries though to see what House (and presumably Senate) Republicans want to advertise is in it: &lt;a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy26_ndaa_conference_one_pager.pdf"&gt;one page summary&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fy26_ndaa_conference_text_legislative_summary.pdf"&gt;a multi-page summary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Procedural note: authorization bills tell you what policies Congress would like to see implemented and how much money they think should be appropriated for them. It &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; actually appropriate those funds. That comes in a separate bill. It's always possible that between authorization and appropriation whole policies get dropped and actual funding can be decreased or increased. But, in general, for massive bills like this, if they make it this far, the appropriations often follow pretty closely because of how much work has gone into negotiating up to this point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's not in the current NDAA?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/jamiedupree/status/1997816135425634623?s=12&amp;amp;t=cV7b5R5rik4TqoNyck6DeQ"&gt;no formal change to the name of the Department of Defense&lt;/a&gt; or to the Secretary thereof&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/12/04/speaker-mike-johnson-working-behind-scenes-slash-ivf-provision-ndaa.html"&gt;coverage for in vitro fertilization (IVF) for service members&lt;/a&gt; - an amendment added such coverage earlier this year and passed both chambers, but as the linked article notes, it appears Speaker Johnson has removed it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;As legislators and journalists have more time to dig into the latest iteration, we'll let you know about additional noteworthy additions or subtractions in the text.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Committee Meetings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/index.php/committee-schedule/weekly/2025/12/08"&gt;46 total committee meetings&lt;/a&gt; for both chambers this week. An often interesting type of committee meeting held by House committees are "member day" meetings. In this kind of meeting, members not on a given committee can come before it to talk about issues they think are important for that committee to deal with. This week there are three: &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/house-event/118726?s=1&amp;amp;r=2"&gt;House Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/house-event/118742?s=1&amp;amp;r=8"&gt;House Foreign Affairs&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, and &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/house-event/118747?s=1&amp;amp;r=1"&gt;House Energy and Commerce&lt;/a&gt; on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Votes This Week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the bills up for a vote this week are bills on suspension meaning they did not go through the House Rules Committee and will therefore require a 2/3rds majority to pass. There are &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/default.aspx"&gt;25 of these bills&lt;/a&gt; listed for the week. Two have the potential to become law: a Senate-originated post office renaming and another authorization bill called the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s356"&gt;S. 356: Secure Rural Schools Reauthorization Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See everyone Friday for the recap to see how closely Congress stuck to its plans for this week.&lt;/p&gt;      </description>

      <description>                &lt;p&gt;In this week's preview, we wrote that the House seems to be operating in split screen. On one hand, members - both between parties and within the Republican majority - seem to be frustrated with each other, leadership, and structural issues in House Rules. On the other hand, they're still holding votes and doing committee work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing in the week changed much. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elise-stefanik-mike-johnson-house-speaker-c41659cb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcGFTz0fBjcwl7GZ-2x90k0tKM2gk4Cb3OuoCstgENjR-Cvp7bYjFmayOHt5Xw%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=693314f5&amp;amp;gaa_sig=B-VMeDGGFb715APcr5JvzvTUU_95RTm9EKdY2RCqcE_b5YCS2aTzewI6_CtxYW6YOWP0jiFhHmK3rUFaIojdlg%3D%3D"&gt;Rep. Stefanik, who's running for NY governor, lashed out publicly at Speaker Johnson&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/03/us/politics/republican-women-speaker-johnson.html?unlocked_article_code=1.6U8.HisX.9HZqbEdc0BeZ&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;several other mostly unnamed members complained&lt;/a&gt; in a different article (NYT gift link).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our preview, we noted that in the House there were 22 bills up for vote on suspension of the rules (which requires a 2/3rds majority for passage) and 6 under a rule (requiring only a simple majority).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;20 of the &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;22 bills&lt;/a&gt; passed by voice vote. The remaining two bills, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4423"&gt;H.R. 4423: No New Burma Funds Act&lt;/a&gt;, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h307"&gt;385-0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr5348"&gt;H.R. 5348: Social Security Child Protection Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h306"&gt;386-0&lt;/a&gt;. One bill will become law and it's the one we noted on Monday: &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/s616"&gt;S. 616: Foundation of the Federal Bar Association Charter Amendments Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;. There's no vote total because this was one of the ones passed by voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we list the 5 (of 6) bills under a rule that received votes, we'll note that in a week otherwise entirely devoted to nominations, the Senate passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hjres131"&gt;H.J.Res. 131&lt;/a&gt;: Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to “Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program Record of Decision” by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/s632"&gt;49-45&lt;/a&gt;. This will also become law once it's signed by the President.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, one bill appears to have been pulled from the floor consideration: &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4312"&gt;H.R. 4312: SCORE Act&lt;/a&gt;. It's not clear when it will be back for a vote based on &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5632295-house-score-act-nil-gop-opposition/"&gt;this Hill article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roll Call Votes in the House&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1005"&gt;H.R. 1005: Combating the Lies of Authoritarians in School Systems Act &lt;/a&gt;, which would equire public elementary and secondary schools to disclose certain funds received from, or contracts with, a foreign source, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h312"&gt;242-176&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1049"&gt;H.R. 1049: Transparency in Reporting of Adversarial Contributions to Education Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would ensure that parents are aware of foreign influence in their child’s public school, passed &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025314"&gt;247-166&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr1069"&gt;H.R. 1069: PROTECT Our Kids Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would prohibit the availability of Federal education funds for elementary and secondary schools that receive direct or indirect support from the Government of the People’s Republic of China, passed &lt;a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025313"&gt;247-164&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr2965"&gt;H.R. 2965: Small Business Regulatory Reduction Act of 2025&lt;/a&gt;, which would require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to ensure that the small business regulatory budget for a small business concern in a fiscal year is not greater than zero, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h310"&gt;223-190&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/119/hr4305"&gt;H.R. 4305: DUMP Red Tape Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would direct the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration to establish a Red Tape Hotline to receive notifications of burdensome agency rules, passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/119-2025/h311"&gt;269-146&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To recap:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;20 of 22 bills passed by voice vote in the House&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;one of the 20 becomes law&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;two got a roll call votes but still have to pass in the Senate&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the SCORE Act didn't get a vote at all&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the Senate nullified a regulation that had already passed the House and that will become law&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you all next week!&lt;/p&gt;      </description>
