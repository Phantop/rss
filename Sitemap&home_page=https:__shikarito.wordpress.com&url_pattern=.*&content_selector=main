      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.06 Dining Hall&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-05-the-interview/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Friend’s discount. Kokuyou priced his research materials at ten silvers for her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While Maomao would have preferred a bigger discount, the high-ranking court physicians had paid fifty silvers for it. As it was not good to be too greedy, she held back. She also wanted to stay on good terms with Kokuyou for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She had the option of getting the high-ranking court physicians show her what they copied as well, but she wanted to review the original text Kokuyou wrote as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou may be particular about money, but he wasn’t a miser. It was just that he used money as an easy way to gauge how people appraised him.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man had a flippant way of speaking, but he was able to think about medicine in a deeply rational way as well. Even though he made concessions for others, he would often suddenly disappear if they continued to make unfair bargains.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t mean that people like Kokuyou who were benevolent to those who treated them badly were kind. He could only do so because he had little attachment to people. She had to bear that fact in mind.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As Maomao read through the copy of Kokuyou’s materials, she nodded in approval. The materials were with her now that the high-ranking court physicians had finished copying it. She was reading it in the dining hall, not in her room since it was much brighter and warmer here. Ten silvers was a great expense, so she wanted to save on oil and charcoal for lighting and heating.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Maomao, what is this?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Changsha came over to look.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I want to ask for a reading fee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But the junior court lady’s salary was much lower than Maomao’s. Since Changsha cooked more often, Maomao decided to let her see it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s research material on epidemics. This might prove useful from now on, so shall we read through it together?” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Are you sure?” Changsha’s face brightened. What an honest child.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She’s different from the girls who come to the pleasure district.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;All the girls who come to the pleasure district have been sold. They came from poor peasant families or were the daughters of merchants who have suddenly fallen into hard times. &lt;em&gt;So it is natural for them to be bitter,&lt;/em&gt; Maomao thought. Although girls with nice personalities do exist as well, they don’t last long without good common sense.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It didn’t mean that the girls who become courtesans have nasty personalities—it was a comparison to show how blessed Changsha was.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou’s handwriting was surprisingly good. There were scribbles in a foreign script in various places as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing these makes me want to see the original text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She heard that Kokuyou’s master was a foreigner, so she figured that Kokuyou’s medicinal vocabulary was mixed with foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Smallpox, huh? Will Yo be alright?” Changsha said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It is what it is. Concern won’t do much, so let us do what we can.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You’re right. Come to think of it,” Changsha looked a little frustrated. She brought up a different topic for a change of mood. “I want to say that Yao-san and En’en-san are the same, but…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I found it unusual that she had an argument with En’en-san the other day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“An argument?” Maomao had an idea what the argument was about. “Could it be about a man?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. Yao-san is a really awkward person, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ah, you can tell?” Maomao found herself agreeing with Changsha.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. Yao-san likes a person called Rahan, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She was so accurate Maomao felt bad for Yao. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Likes, might not be right term for it, but well. Rather, you even know his name, huh?” Maomao had no idea if Yao was aware of her feeling yet.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. En’en-san is always letting it slip. While she has a face of a demon. Also, I have pretty much grasped it from the hints the two of them were dropping. How audacious, right? To come up with a reason to settle into the house of the person you like. The topic of the argument was about whether it’s time they should move out.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao nodded in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Also, En’en-san only has eyes for Yao-san. The person that comes over to see En’en-san from time to time gets mercilessly cut off too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Uh huh.” Rahan’s older brother’s face came to mind. His real name was Kan-something-san.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yao-san is awkward as well. Is the target of her feelings someone who would sprout love from having her getting close to him by staying at his residence? I think normally, he would find them noisy and annoying. Well, Yao-san is from a good family. She&amp;#8217;s wealthy. She&amp;#8217;s attractive too. So, it would only be enviable for those from the unrelated male camp. The person concerned would find it utterly unbearable.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, honest child, repeal that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The honest child had observed the bad points of her seniors and spoke frankly about it. Given how she passed the exam, she was a smart child.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Will you say this before the people in question?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“There’s no way I can.” Changsha shook her head. “But for the both of them, I don’t think this will end unless they give up and express their feelings or they come to their senses. It would be good to have a third party come in, but it would be difficult since Yao-san is stubborn.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao was also of the same mind.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“En’en-san has no way of telling Yao-san directly, and even if she did, she would be shrugged off. She can only indirectly argue with her with talks of moving out.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It probably wasn’t a real argument. En’en had to be fully feeling regretful towards Yao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“There &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;one other way to resolve it, but it has the lowest chance of happening.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ahh, would it be for the other party to like her too?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;t in a million years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Maomao shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But it is possible that Rahan person could give in, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“She comes with a very scary sister-in-law called En’en, though?” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That is a terrifying thought.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There were barely any people left in the dining hall whilst they were chatting. The dorm manager was imploring them to leave with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Well then, shall we get ready for bed?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao got up from her seat and picked up the research materials.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And that was when she became aware of the characteristic sound of footsteps approaching.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Good daaaay.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;To end her speech in such a characteristic way, it could only be Chue.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not the time for &lt;em&gt;good day&lt;/em&gt; anymore. The sun has already set.” Maomao sensed trouble in the air. “Changsha, please head to bed. You have an early start tomorrow too, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Excuse me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although Changsha was curious, Maomao headed to work. “Now then, what could today’s matter be about? Are we going to watch Basen-sama again? Wouldn’t that be considered voyeurism at this time of the day? More importantly, I doubt Basen-sama has the finesse to ask girls out in the middle of the night.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. Chue-san won’t have to work so hard if my brother-in-law can sneak into a woman’s bedroom or arrange for a tryst. Shall we take him to the Verdigris Mansion for practice again?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Absolutely not. The madam will beat me up if he struggled and destroyed the building.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Also, she had no idea how high the madam would overcharge in the reparations bill.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“How unfortunate. Today’s matter is not about my brother-in-law. A slight problem came up, so won&amp;#8217;t you come to the Moon Prince’s place today?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“May I ask what this problem is?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi had been summoning Maomao less often for matters like this. He no longer had to excuse to have her come in for wound treatment, and he must be busy with work as well. But would the biggest reason be that the person himself was drawing a line?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And so, Maomao presumed that he had summoned her for a proper reason this time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There were no other court ladies in the dining hall. The dorm manager, perhaps having read the room, had stepped outside.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Chue leaned towards Maomao’s ear. “A cursed jar has been found under the eaves of a certain government official’s house.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Oh my, what a nostalgic matter.” It was a matter Maomao heard all the time back when she was at the inner palace.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“And a troubling point is how that the government official’s daughter is getting weaker.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;To the point that the matter would be brought to Jinshi. She guessed that they had to be quite a high-ranking family even though they were calling them a government official.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You mean to break the curse.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, just as Maomao-san says.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I do not believe in curses?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Fufufu, that is your feelings. Even if curses don’t exist for Maomao-san, for other people, they can only call things they can’t explain a curse.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reasonable&lt;/em&gt;, Maomao thought as well. “Is there a possibility of there being poison?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Chue was all smiles. “Won’t you come with meee?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Can’t be helped,” Maomao said, although she didn’t look displeased at all.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a bad side of me&lt;/em&gt;, she thought, but it was an unchangeable part of Maomao’s nature.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: Since it&amp;#8217;s been so long, I forgot how I usually translated Rokushoukan, or if I did at all, so I&amp;#8217;m going with my personal pick for the translation this time&amp;#8230;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-07-the-cursed-jar-1/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-06-dining-hall/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5027-6905976b87cf1' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5027&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5027-6905976b87cf1' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5027-6905976b87cf1' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-06-dining-hall/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been getting a dozen emails a day with the same question. It&amp;#8217;s on the discord server. The link to the discord server is on this site. Look at my old posts. Scroll down the page a little. I&amp;#8217;ve left enough clues to get you there. It shouldn&amp;#8217;t be too difficult to find it if you just read what I wrote. Any more emails from people demanding the password from me outright will be ignored from now on, I mean it. Everyone else found the passwords themselves. If they can do that, you can do it too. I&amp;#8217;ve been patient enough to let it go on for months. I&amp;#8217;ve had enough, so I&amp;#8217;m putting my foot down now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the people getting the expired link notice when they try to enter the server via their browser, try using the discord app instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I&amp;#8217;m still getting a dozen emails a day after this, I will revert back to the old ways 😤&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-5289 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/arc-11-password-locked/" target="_self" &gt;Arc 11 Gone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2025-01-20T14:41:50+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2025/01/20/arc-11-password-locked/"&gt;January 20th, 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;A bit delayed since LN13 has been out for a while now, but arc 11 is now hidden behind a password. As usual, the password is in the same place as the arc 10 password.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;s&gt;I should also mention that 11.10 has the most views out of all the chapters on this blog. As of today, it has 51k views, when the other chapters get an average of 15k views&amp;#8230; is it the power of frog?&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Finally got around to cleaning up the site, so arc 11 has been taken down like I was supposed to ages ago lol (I&amp;#8217;ll keep my portion of arc 10 up since Duchess&amp;#8217; chapters are still up)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4919 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/10/15/arc-10-password-locked/" target="_self" &gt;Arc 10 password&amp;nbsp;locked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-10-15T21:00:37+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/10/15/arc-10-password-locked/"&gt;October 15th, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;LN12 is out in English, so I did my thing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the password? Find it in the discord server.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As is tradition when I take down chapters, the locked chapters have undergone a minor edit, polish, or rewrite depending on how much the original version bothered me. Chapters with major changes have an edited date on the top of the page. (I haven&amp;#8217;t gone through all the chapters yet.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4779 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-kusuriya-no-hitorigoto"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/05/18/caught-up-once-again/" target="_self" &gt;Caught up once&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-05-18T01:09:14+10:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/05/18/caught-up-once-again/"&gt;May 18th, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey, lookie, the menu has finally been edited. Took me only 5 month since the previous post to do so&amp;#8230; I also took the opportunity to change the site theme, since the previous one was starting to bother me for some reason. The new theme&amp;#8217;s limited colour options (black, black, or black!!!) is a little unfortunate, but still, it&amp;#8217;s pretty.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;New header image is Maomao, since she&amp;#8217;s Best Girl xD&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now for updates since the previous post:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The web novel translation is now up to date. You can read &lt;strong&gt;arc 10 chapter 28 &lt;/strong&gt;all the way to&lt;strong&gt; arc 13 chapter 16&lt;/strong&gt; here. Earlier chapters of arc 10 can be found at Duchess&amp;#8217; site.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Arcs 1 to 9, which was on Creative Novels, have been taken down since the light novel equivalents are officially released in English. &lt;s&gt;(I&amp;#8217;ll delete arc 9 in two-ish days, so people catching up better read fast haha)&lt;/s&gt; Arc 9 is gone too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Also, I am aware that the font colour for the KnH character page is whacked. I haven&amp;#8217;t figured how to change it with the new WordPress editor, so bear with the random black text for now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m going to hibernate until the next arc begins. Let me know when the next chapter drops, thanks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4273 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/its-not-dropped/" target="_self" &gt;It&amp;#8217;s not dropped!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2023-12-05T04:31:14+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/its-not-dropped/"&gt;December 5th, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;I figured I should clarify this. The menu needs updating. &lt;strong&gt;The Kusuriya webnovel translation has not been dropped&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, I did drop it three years ago (hence the dropped tag), and have only just resumed mid-September this year, so it hasn&amp;#8217;t been long. I&amp;#8217;ll get around to editing that drop down menu one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, arc 11 is finished, &lt;s&gt;and I&amp;#8217;m nearly done with arc 12. Arc 13 does not exist yet.&lt;/s&gt; Done with arc 12 as well, working on arc 13 now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If you want notifications for whenever I upload a new chapter, come join us on the discord server. The link can be found a few posts below this one&amp;#8211;to clarify, it&amp;#8217;s not the Reddit one.  Just note that there will be open spoilers for the latest chapter of the BG manga at least for the entire server (and for their respective channels, open spoilers for the latest LN volume/WN chapter, etc), so anime-only people, beware. Although, I doubt it&amp;#8217;d be much of an issue if you guys are here for the webnovel anyway.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Why are the new chapters not posted on Novelupdates? Arc 10 isn&amp;#8217;t finished yet, and I&amp;#8217;d rather not deal with scrapers and stuff like I did in the past. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Also, arcs 1 to 8 have been taken down from creative novels since the LN equivalents have been published. Arc 9 is the last one left on that site, and will be nuked the moment LN11 is released.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For&lt;strong&gt; people wondering about arc 10&lt;/strong&gt;, you can find it &lt;a href="https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/chapter-listing/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Duchess is translating that one. It&amp;#8217;s not finished yet. She&amp;#8217;s up to chapter 27 out of 35, but will be resuming soon enough. (I&amp;#8217;m not counting the MTL&amp;#8217;d chapters that had somehow found its way onto Novelupdates.) &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are directly jumping in from the latest published LN translation&lt;/strong&gt; (LN9), you can continue from arc 9, which is equivalent to LN10 and LN11. Arc 10 is LN12, Arc 11 is LN13, and Arc 12 is LN14. There will be some differences, of course&amp;#8211;not as drastic as the earlier arcs, but there is notably less romance in the WN. LN scenes tend to be more fleshed out as well. (Also, I don&amp;#8217;t have anyone editing my translations, so I apologise if it&amp;#8217;s not as polished as the officials are.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this clears up most of the questions people have been asking.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Edit: Wow, it&amp;#8217;s been a while since I last made a post on this site.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Edit 2: I eat my words. Arc 13 begins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3817 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/06/03/official-english-release-of-ln2-is-today/" target="_self" &gt;Official English Release of LN2 is&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-06-03T14:51:48+10:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/06/03/official-english-release-of-ln2-is-today/"&gt;June 3rd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Go and get it!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(also, a little notice that arc 2 has been nuked from creative novels, in case people are wondering why it&amp;#8217;s gone :&amp;#8217;D)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3783 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/ln11-releases-on-april-30/" target="_self" &gt;LN11 releases on April&amp;nbsp;30!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-04-14T13:01:09+10:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/ln11-releases-on-april-30/"&gt;April 14th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="708" height="1024" src="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91ksrh451hs.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3784" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Way sooner than expected! And this should be roughly equivalent to the latter half of arc 9 of the webnovel version 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a limited edition that comes bundled with another drama CD. &lt;br&gt;It comes with three tracks: &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;1) Jade Palace Girls Talk &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao is having afternoon tea with Jade Palace attendants Infa, Gui&amp;#8217;en and Airan. Gui&amp;#8217;en sparks a girls talk session by asking, &amp;#8220;Was there anyone good at the garden party?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;2/3) The Mystery of the Sake Bottle&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao had been dismissed from being a palace lady at the inner palace and is now employed as Jinshi&amp;#8217;s personal attendant. She heads to the pleasure district with Jinshi and Gaoshun in tow, going after the mystery of the broken sake bottle that had been left behind by an enigmatic person at the side of a well at dawn. And there, she comes across&amp;#8230;?!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Cast: &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao: Yuuki Aoi&lt;br&gt;Jinshi: Takahiro Sakurai&lt;br&gt;Gaoshun: Tsuda Kenjirou&lt;br&gt;Rihaku: Takumi Yasuaki&lt;br&gt;Rahan: Kobayashi Chiaki&lt;br&gt;Quack Doctor: Ogata Mitsuru&lt;br&gt;Infa: Kamiyou Saeko&lt;br&gt;Gui&amp;#8217;en: Moriya Kyouka&lt;br&gt;Airan: Kawano Mari&lt;br&gt;Suiren/Honnyan: Nitta Kyousuke&lt;br&gt;Owner of Kujaku Brothel: Nakano Taisuke&lt;br&gt;A kamuro: Tadano Akari&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On a side note, yes, the webnovel has resumed. There are currently four chapters out as of today. It looks like we&amp;#8217;ll be looking into who will be succeeding as the next leader of the western capital. Will it be Gyoku&amp;#8217;ou&amp;#8217;s second son or his third son? Shall we cast lots? What is the prodigal first son up to, anyways?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The continuation of the translation has been picked up by Duchess. You can find it here: &lt;a href="https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt; or on the kusuriya discord server.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;There&amp;#8217;s actually a lot of things happening on discord, so do come visit when you can!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Also, if you&amp;#8217;re wondering what I&amp;#8217;m up to, I&amp;#8217;m part of the scanlation team that working on the GX version of the manga. I&amp;#8217;m still around, for better or worse hahahahaha&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3761 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/02/14/volume-1-of-the-ln-releases-today/" target="_self" &gt;Volume 1 of the LN releases&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-02-14T08:45:55+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/02/14/volume-1-of-the-ln-releases-today/"&gt;February 14th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can find it in pretty much at any place that sells ebooks of English translated light novels 😀 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Technically it&amp;#8217;s another eight hours or so from now due to timezone differences, but I&amp;#8217;ve no time to do all this when it is actually released in the US, so now&amp;#8217;s the time, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Well, this is it, guys.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The light novel version of Kusuriya no Hitorigoto (Apothecary diaries) has been licensed by J-novel Club, and so, with the release of the first volume today (February 14th 2021), the first volume/arc of this translation will be taken down today per J-novel club&amp;#8217;s request.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It feels a bit bittersweet having worked on this project for so long, but it is what it is. The next volume will be taken down when the next official LN is published.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3746 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/discord-server/" target="_self" &gt;Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2020-11-25T14:29:22+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/25/discord-server/"&gt;November 25th, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone was kind enough to make a discord server for Kusuriya no Hitorigoto, so if you can&amp;#8217;t get enough of Maomao (and Jinshi), you can find us here:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/xqDqAEAjxH" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://discord.gg/xqDqAEAjxH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Please join us!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;See you guys there 😀&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Edit: we have a subreddit too!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/KusuriyaNoHitorigoto/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://old.reddit.com/r/KusuriyaNoHitorigoto/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3742 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/ln-volume-10/" target="_self" &gt;LN volume 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2020-11-24T23:59:50+11:00"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/ln-volume-10/"&gt;November 24th, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="707" height="1023" src="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/enkp5qduuaedhty.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3743" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So, the author just revealed on twitter.

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.07 The Curse Jar&amp;nbsp;(1)&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-06-dining-hall/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With Chue leading the way, Maomao was brought to Jinshi’s palace, or so she had thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The carriage arrived at a warehouse near Jinshi’s palace. At the site, lit by bonfires, were Jinshi, Basen, and Mamei. There were other guards she recognised, but as always, she didn’t remember their names, so let’s leave them out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorrry for being late at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was warmer than expected inside the warehouse. There was light as well as a few braziers. Although, she was uneasy about ventilation–Maomao made sure the windows and entranceway had been left ajar.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Pardon me for summoning you.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi was sitting on a simple chair, looking at a suspicious jar. It wasn’t the palace, but she could see the effort put into making this place as comfortable as possible. A space alike a small room had been built in the interior of the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sorry for the abruptness, but can you take a look?” He glanced at Maomao, but shook his head lightly as if to tell himself that it wasn’t the time for this.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What an icky jar,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t try to touch it while saying it’s filthy.” Jinshi slapped Maomao’s hand away.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If I do not touch it, we will not know what is inside.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We can leave that for someone else to do, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The jar was big enough to rest on two open palms. It was firmly sealed, with several talisman-like sheets pasted onto the lid. Curses had been written on the talisman, making it the very picture of a curse jar.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Suiren probably didn’t allow cursed items to be brought into the palace, which was why they were doing this in this warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What does it contain?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We have yet to investigate. It seems to be filled with a liquid. It shouldn’t be a poison derived from insects,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Well, it had been left long enough to liquify, that would be nasty.” Maomao had once neglected a snake she had been raising. At the time, it had dried up into a husk. “What if it contains blood?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Maomao-san, you bring up unpleasant things to imagine, huuuh?” Chue was dramatically frightened.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So this was found at a high official’s house, right?” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah,” Jinshi replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“And it was brought to Jinshi-sama’s place.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao let out a huge breath.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It would be a different matter if it were the Eunuch Jinshi, but a personage had brought the curse jar to the imperial brother. No one would do such a bold thing. Normally, it would be perceived as disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have one person in mind who&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;em&gt;d do such a thing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But it wouldn’t be. The weirdo tactician was the first person that came to Maomao’s mind. That person would cook up something much different to harass Jinshi. Also, he would do it personally if it was an act that would harm himself. He wouldn’t need Jinshi’s help.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In that case…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She pondered through the process of elimination.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Could it be related to the empress dowager’s family?” Although she had hesitated, she brought it up now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi let out a big sigh instead of replying.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Also, with how clearly Basen was shaken, it had to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Word is that it was buried under the eaves. It was discovered by a cat they raised,” Jinshi said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What a clever cat.” Maomao took out a towel from her breast pocket and wrapped her right hand in it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What are you planning to do?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You told me to investigate, but at this rate, we will not be able to do anything. How about I give it a feel for the time being?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But–”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi looked like he had a lot to say. Chue looked amused and Mamei held a towel out to Basen.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll do it,” Basen said as he wrapped his hand in the towel. “My body is not so weak that it would lose to the likes of a curse.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, that’s true, but–”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Both Jinshi and Maomao looked uneasy. What should they do at a time like this? It seemed like some flag had been hoisted into the air.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Rather than Basen-sama, you should leave it to me,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, Maomao-san. My younger brother should be able to do this at least–”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A crack resounded without waiting for Mamei’s words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A broken jar sat on Basen’s hand. He looked embarrassed. “With my hand wrapped up, I couldn’t control my strength…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You stupid younger brother!” Mamei’s humble expression transformed into that of a demon’s and she smashed a fist into Basen’s chin. The other guards wondered if they should stop her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Basen-sama is no good with fragile items, I see,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah. I knew that, I knew, but..” Jinshi was clutching his head too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao crouched down and checked the smashed jar and the fluid that had spilled out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Can Maomao-san see?” Chue brought the light closer for Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, that helps.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The contents were a dark fluid. It had a characteristic smell. It didn’t seem to be blood.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Hey!” Jinshi stopped Maomao who had dipped her finger into the fluid. “What if you get cursed?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I will not get cursed. It is more annoying than a curse, though.” Maomao took a whiff of the fluid on her fingers. It smelt like tea. “As expected, poison. More correctly it would be poison in the middle of maturation.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was a strongly brewed tea.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-08-the-curse-jar-2/"&gt;Next chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-07-the-cursed-jar-1/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5040-6905976b86a9b' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5040&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5040-6905976b86a9b' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5040-6905976b86a9b' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-07-the-cursed-jar-1/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;15.03 Peach Blossom&amp;nbsp;Bookstore&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: The peach blossom symbolises a lot of things, but the key one for this chapter would probably be &lt;em&gt;romance&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-02-the-story-of-the-villainess/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The next day, Maomao went to work as always.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The book by Chou San had already passed through the hands of all the courtesans at Verdigris Mansion, so there were no issues with Maomao taking it home.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Daylight hours had gotten shorter as well, so she thought to read it in between work.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Oh? You brought in something unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Li showed interest. Her senior, who used to be earnest and square in personality, had become square in the broadness of his shoulders recently. He had been eating nothing but chicken lately, saying that it was good for growing muscle, and had been giving Maomao the skin.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pairin-neechan would be delighted if I were to introduce him to her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But she shouldn&amp;#8217;t. It would be troubling if it created an awkward atmosphere with Rihaku.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If you want to, you can read it. I’m not free yet.” Maomao was wrapping the medicine into paper pouches.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, I’ve… read this before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“How surprising. You read these sorts of things, too?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The story was springing up everywhere like bamboo shoots after the Shi clan insurrection. Books have been spreading more even before then, which led to it being read in turn at the medical office too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Was this the result of Jinshi popularising novels?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“In the early days, there were a lot of books with questionable content on the market, but I recall that before long the dodgy ones disappeared. I remember reading that book once the popularity died down.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“When was that?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Before we went to the western capital. I don’t think it’s been two years.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao checked the calendar in her mind. Was it around a year and a half after the Shi clan insurrection?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If you want to read this kind of story, I’ll introduce you to a bookstore that has a lot of these. I know the owner. She’s fond of gossip.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Oh? Court Physician Li goes to that kind of shop, I see.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“N-no, I-I was just accompanying!” Court Physician Li frantically clarified. She could see his clenched fists were muscular with prominent blue veins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Do you have any idea about what kind of person the author could be?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Why are you asking me? Hmmm, based on the surprisingly beautiful style of writing, they must have been educated.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Anything else?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Anything else, you ask me…” Court Physician Li groaned with the book in one hand. “Occasionally, failed government officials and those folks who have given up on the imperial examination would try their hand at popular things for the sake of money. You know how they write beautifully, but there&amp;#8217;s this characteristic vibe&amp;#8211;get what I mean?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I get it too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A vibe a bit like they&amp;#8217;re looking down on you.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“But this book is different from those.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Seems like he couldn’t explain it well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao had a sense that Court Physician Li wasn’t good at putting things into words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Anyway, can you tell me about that gossip-loving shop?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So, you want to go there after all?” Court Physician Li took a sheet of paper for record-keeping use and smoothly wrote on it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He wrote ‘Peach Blossom Bookstore.’ It seems to be located at the western end of the capital.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Peach blossom…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Li panicked as if he had noticed Maomao’s fixed gaze. “It’s not that kind of shop!”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I know. Thank you.” Maomao bowed her head and slipped the paper into her bosom pocket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When work ended, she immediately headed for the bookstore she was referred to.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Excuse me. To the capital’s west gate.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She had hailed a carriage in this rare instance to save time on both getting there and coming back. Normally, Maomao was a little stingy, but the sun set early in winter. She thought it would be better in case it got too late and there wouldn&amp;#8217;t be any carriages left.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Peach Blossom Bookstore was situated on the first side street coming off the main street from the west gate. It helped that the driver knew the bookstore. It seems that occasionally people with curious tastes would buy a large volume of books then go home, so the driver has made the round trip before.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then, I’ll entrust you to bring me back as well,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Be back before the next bell rings,” the driver said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Understood.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao entered the bookstore. It was dim inside and had the characteristic smell of paper. The overflowing bookshelves were crammed with books, and books that couldn’t fit on the shelves were left on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Excuse me.” Maomao headed deeper inside. “Excuuuse me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What is it?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She heard a sleepy voice.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A portly woman emerged sluggishly from within. Was she well into her thirties? She had a plate in hand, which had a pair of chopsticks stabbed into a daikon.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ahh, I forgot to close up shop.” The woman bit into the stabbed daikon. Her cheeks, which looked like swollen rice cakes, were excessively glossy.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If you’re here to buy, do it quickly. I want to eat my dinner,” she said and went to put the closed signboard outside. It seems she would only wait for Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I do want to shop, but…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Excuse me, but do you know this book?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“This book?” the woman looked at the book Maomao brought over. “Ahh.” She clapped her hands together, then started to rummage through the mountain of books on the floor. “Is this it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The book the woman showed Maomao was the same as the one she brought in. The title and name of the author were both the same. Although the text inside was also the same, it didn&amp;#8217;t have the same writer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If the manuscript was handwritten, then either one could be the copied version. Otherwise, both could be copied versions.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Hehehe. This book is quite interesting. Yeah, I’m aware it’s a classic. You&amp;#8217;d already know how it ends if you know the story of our Moon Prince.” The woman continued while eating the rest of the daikon, “I liked how strangely vivid the minor details were. But, well, it’s behind the times and similar stories sell for dirt cheap nowadays.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The woman tapped the books that couldn’t fit on the shelves. They were all works with similar titles.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Do you know the author of this book?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Nope. At the very least, there is no author by the name of Chou San.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Really?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The woman circled the suspecting Maomao. She was light on her feet despite her large build. “Yeah. At the very least, there is no work by that author among the books in this shop. Failed poets who can’t make ends meet might publish under a changed name, but it doesn’t seem like this would be the case.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The woman was neither young nor a beauty. However, Maomao knew that she held absolute power in this shop. In a sense, the bookstore was the castle she was the lord of.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ah, but…” the woman clapped her hands together, then flipped through the book. “This expression is peculiar to the north, so there&amp;#8217;s a good chance that they hail from Shihoku Province. They&amp;#8217;re probably fairly well-educated.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao’s eyes widened, and she gulped. “Could it be the writing of an upper-class woman?” &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What am I thinking? &lt;/em&gt;she thought to herself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Nah, probably not. I couldn’t see signs of that.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“…” Maomao was dejected by the clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Did you think it was written by someone you know?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Even if it’s not someone you know, do you want to know the author?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Do you know?” Maomao leaned over.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Even if I don’t know the author, the guy who produced the copy might know. Looking up handwriting is child’s play for me. Also, if the same book comes up for sale again, I&amp;#8217;ll ask where they got it from. Should I hold onto it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Please do. As thanks&amp;#8230; I’ll give you what I can.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even Maomao had saved up a reasonable amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Alrighty. You can leave it to this Xiongmao-neechan.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Xiongmao?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What about it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, I just found your name very familiar,” Maomao said to the woman who was literally like a panda.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So, what’s your name?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s Maomao.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Your name is also very familiar to me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s just how it was.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T/N: random, but I can&amp;#8217;t help noticing that some people are calling this arc &amp;#8220;WN17&amp;#8221; &amp;#8230;.how did you guys get two arcs ahead of me? &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Anyway, new name:&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;熊猫 &amp;#8211; Shonmao &amp;#8211; Panda&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;(literally Bear Cat, hence the parallel with Maomao&amp;#8217;s name) &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;After this, Silksong calls, so see you all in a few week&amp;#8217;s time maybe?&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(Next Chapter)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-03-peach-blossom-bookstore/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5556-6905f8597ccca' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5556&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5556-6905f8597ccca' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5556-6905f8597ccca' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-03-peach-blossom-bookstore/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;SS: Sazen&amp;#8217;s Secret&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sound of something falling on snow. Was it a dead body?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man had stolen a horse from the stables and was fastening his loot to it. He had taken part in the Shi clan&amp;#8217;s insurrection. Of course, it wasn’t out of some lofty ambition. The man was a peasant–he only worked as a guard at the fortress to earn money for food.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He was going to mount the horse and escape as soon as he could. What was he thinking, going to check to see what had fallen?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;My lady?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl was buried in the soft snow. Unconscious. There was a hole in the chest area of her dress. The unending white snow piled over her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Her name was Loulan. The daughter of the patriarch of the Shi clan, the leader of this insurrection. She had entered the inner palace to be the emperor’s concubine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Was she dead? No, puffs of her breath coloured the air white.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man swallowed. The girl who had been summoned away by the person above the heavens was so dazzlingly beautiful to a peasant. Such a person was breathing weakly before his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Ngh.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A pained sound slipped out. She seemed to be really weak.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Find her!&lt;em&gt; Find her&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He heard voices. It was the lot who came to suppress the insurrection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man panicked. If he didn’t hightail it out of here in time, he may well be decapitated. And yet, the fallen girl weighed on his mind. She would be discovered if he left her be. Even if she weren’t found, she would be buried in snow and freeze to death.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man clutched his head, groaned and then sighed. He hoisted the girl out of the snow and over his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sorry. It’s a little heavy, so bear with it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man offloaded one of the items he stole. There was another thing he had, but he couldn’t get rid of those. He got on the horse with the girl in front of him and tugged the reins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man regretted picking up the unexpected thing he found. In an empty hut, he opened her dress. He couldn’t leave her in wet clothes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The hut was for hunters before they entered the forest. Thanks to that, there was a pelt, which he could use to cover and warm her up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl’s, Loulan’s, chest was bruised blue-black. The hole in her dress was from a firearm. Be it luck, a silver hairstick had caught it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With hesitation, the man extended his hand to Loulan’s chest. While somehow keeping calm from the soft sensation, he checked the condition of her bones. Her ribs weren’t broken. However, she had a fever and looked like she was in pain. She had fallen in the snow. Since her physical energy had dropped, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for her to catch a cold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He wouldn’t be able to run far with a sick person in tow. He would be quickly found if he brought Loulan with him. Loulan was certainly the daughter of his former employer, but he didn’t have that much of a sense of duty to go that far. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Rather, he thought that having brought her to a hut where she wouldn’t be discovered was good enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was snowing outside. The snow probably won’t be stopping any time soon, but as he was used to long winters, he would have no trouble escaping in this environment by himself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Can you, do me a favour?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man heard a hoarse voice. He turned around. Loulan, wrapped in the pelt, was awake.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Th-these books…”&amp;nbsp; In Loulan’s hand was an item the man had looted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The cloth bag was filled with thick books. When did she see them?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Bring them… to the capital.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;What are you saying?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was troubling that she was telling him to take them to the capital. The man was currently on the run because of the army that came from the very capital. Once it was known that he participated in the insurrection, he would be arrested.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I beg, of you…” She got up and bowed her head deeply. The woman who had slept with the emperor before was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man had a sex drive that was like anyone else. A beautiful woman was bowing her head before him like this. There was no one to stop him, and the woman wouldn’t be able to defy him either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He could do whatever he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;… were the vulgar thoughts that crossed his mind. Just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“For the sake of this country…” Her voice was feeble. And yet, her eyes were bright with a burning fervour.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;For the sake of this country…&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;What an odd thing to say. Wasn’t she the daughter of the ringleader who tried to bring down the country?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, the man was overpowered by the sparkle in her eyes. Overpowered by a woman who was much weaker than he, who was known as the ephemeral palace*.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*probably a pun from Loulan&amp;#8217;s name. Lou &amp;gt; Palace (Roukaku), but ephemeral.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I, I got it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At the same time that naturally came out of his mouth, Loulan collapsed in relief.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He treated her with what he learnt by imitation. In the end, he couldn’t abandon her and waited until Loulan got better. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He entered the forest and looked for medicinal herbs. Previously, he had been at a place where he had gathered medicinal herbs as an errand boy. He somehow kept his eyes on the goal, dug up the snow and found it. He had the doctor who had him work as the errand boy to teach him how to brew medicine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He made sure to light a fire at night. To keep warm, the two of them would sleep under the same pelt. It wasn’t that he didn’t get strange urges. But if he laid his hands on her, he had a feeling he would be the one eaten rather than the one eating.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be odd to describe her as a beauty who could bring a nation to ruin. Not her appearance, there was a quality to her that ordinary people didn&amp;#8217;t have.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Am I not attractive? I’m not flat either.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As her health improved, she would make such jokes. Thanks to that, the man also spoke casually.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After a short time, Loulan recovered greatly as well. Although the snow had yet to show signs of stopping, they decided to leave the hut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When they arrived at a village to the south that was quite some distance from the fortress, Loulan suggested they part ways.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I might end up selling the books, you know,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That can’t be helped since I can’t go to the capital. But it’s better than having the books burn with the fortress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What will you do?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There was nowhere for her to go. The world wasn’t so nice for a woman to escape alone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’m thinking of running further south.” Loulan grinned. “See ya. All the best.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She turned her back on him without any reluctance to part.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ah, that’s right. It would be nice if you could be a herbalist. It might be your calling.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No way.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The laughing girl disappeared beyond the snow. He might never see her again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, Loulan’s words resonated with him. He felt her words somehow became the source of encouragement for him to keep on living.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That was exactly why he won&amp;#8217;t tell anyone, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/ss-sazens-secret/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5479-6905976ba1085' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5479&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5479-6905976ba1085' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5479-6905976ba1085' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/ss-sazens-secret/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;15.01 Older Brother&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Care&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: So the WN has resumed and I&amp;#8217;m already hit with the quandary of picking the best translation for titles. The arc title especially, but I&amp;#8217;ll talk about it at the end of this chapter.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;The chapter title seems to be going for the two senses of the word: 1) to help things grow or develop; 2) a place that looks after kids i.e. day care/nursery/childcare&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-24-houkou/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The sound of soil being tilled filled the air.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao gazed absently at the man working the fields with her chin resting on her hand.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;They were just outside the castle walls of the capital—where the field Maomao and her adoptive father Luomen cultivated was. No, where it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The guards had turned a blind eye to the field in exchange for them dealing with the kudzu that clung to the walls, however…&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The field hadn’t received proper care for the past couple of years. It had been left to run wild.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the kudzu on the wall was the only thing completely cleared away.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When was it again that the kudzu got eradicated?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She remembered bringing Sazen and Kokuyou along to harvest the plant.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Back then, she had known nothing about Kokuyou’s true nature. As she hadn’t known, she naïvely believed that he wasn&amp;#8217;t a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Right now, the one on the field wasn’t Luomen nor Sazen.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“This place is great!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was Rahan’s older brother, wiping the sweat off his brow with a lively expression.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Apparently he had ploughed and ploughed the garden at the weirdo tactician’s residence and when he proceeded to plough even outside the residence, he was told that he wasn&amp;#8217;t allowed to do that.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That goes without saying.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And it was for that reason he came to ask Maomao for any suitable land. After reserving the field at the dilapidated shack at the pleasure district to grow medicinal herbs, this was the only place serviceable.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Rahan’s older brother is always in good spirits, huh?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Health is wealth, after all. You gotta eat well, sleep well and move well,” he answered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What are you growing?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There didn’t seem to be anything that could be grown considering the season. Looking at Rahan’s older brother would make you feel like it was sweltering, but the air he breathed out was white.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Nah, I wasn’t thinking about growing anything specific. I just thought about preparing for cold season cultivation and soil improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a countermeasure against locusts either, right?” Even Maomao knew that turning up the soil worked to prevent locust outbreaks. She had done more than enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Well, for the time being, scatter these for me.” Rahan’s older brother pointed to a large sack. She peered inside to see shells that had been grounded into powder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You guys help me out, too,” he called out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;““Okaaaay.””&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Children gathered around Rahan’s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sifan, Wufan, Liufan, Junjie, and then Zhizi.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It became an odd group.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao crossed her arms and looked on in amazement.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Junjie aside, it was odd to see Zhizi blending in with them. She had been such a sickly young lady when she came in, and yet she was currently clad in dirty clothes and straw boots. It might not be snowing, but it was cold outside.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Who would think that the child with flushed cheeks scattering powdered shell was the empress dowager’s niece and the emperor’s cousin?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl was having so much fun that Maomao loathed to stop her. More importantly, it was delightful to see her running around energetically. Her starved beast period had been shocking, but it seems the girl had pretty much settled down nowadays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Heeey, you’ve scattered too much there. You have to scatter it around evenly. If you don’t do it properly, the crops will grow badly.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Okaaaay.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Upon hearing such an obedient reply, Maomao was reminded of Chou’u, who was in his rebellious age, at the pleasure district.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I leave him with Rahan’s older brother, would he become obedient?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Rahan’s older brother was popular, but he wasn’t ambitious. So far as it goes, he had the desire to succeed in life by getting rich like an average person, but his current look suited him too well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come to think of it, Rahan had tricked him into going to the western capital.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although Rahan’s older brother’s name hadn’t been recorded, his achievements might be passed down in the western lands for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just don’t start an uprising.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She could only imagine him leading the peasants with a hoe in hand, were he to start some rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Heeey, Rahan’s younger sister. If you’re idle, help out,” Rahan’s older brother called out. He could call Maomao ‘Rahan’s younger sister’ every now and then. Normally, she would cut back with a “I’m not his sister,” but she would let it slide at times for Rahan’s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Rather than me being idle, weren’t you the one to ask me to bring you to a place that could become a field?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But moving your body once in a while will do you good. Just now the expression you made seemed like you were at your wits’ end.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Seems like he sensed that she was distressed by something.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He’s oddly sharp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But he didn’t pry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao was distressed over how she should deal with the existence known as Kokuyou.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The man was harmless to those who were harmless, and harmful to those who were harmful. For a living being, his actions were just.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She wanted to believe it would be fine to have him hang around Verdigris Mansion with how things were. Sazen, whom she had left to manage the apothecary, wasn’t a bad person by nature. The madam may be a miser, but she doesn’t conduct criminal business.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;If it were Maomao in the past, she would simply turn a blind eye. However, having been in contact with people who were close to the law, she ended up getting distressed over whether Kokuyou should be punished for straying from the path so many times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Rahan’s older brother had discerned what Maomao had been distressed over. “You look like you&amp;#8217;re thinking about something you can do nothing about.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I&amp;#8217;m thinking about something I can do nothing about.” Maomao let out a big sigh.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;What would be Maomao’s guiding principles at a time like this?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m just wasting time by thinking about something where thinking won’t give me answers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Set it aside for now. Do what she could do now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll forget about it for now and do some work.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That’s the spirit. Rather, it would be great if Rahan could come along too. That guy is top heavy and doesn’t exercise at all.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Rahan would be out of commission the day after.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You’re right.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao took the hoe from Rahan’s older brother and went to till the powdered shell into the ground.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After working in the fields, Maomao parted ways with Rahan’s older brother’s group midway. She hadn’t intended to work with soil, so she hadn’t brought a change of clothes with her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As there was no way she would return to the dorms covered in dirt, she decided to stop by the pleasure district.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Woah, you’re dirty.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Chou’u was at the dilapidated shack Maomao used to live in. It seems the brat, who was in the middle of his rebellious phase, had overtaken Maomao’s height.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’m just here for a change of clothes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“…” Chou’u’s mood immediately soured and he left the shack.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What an attitude.” Maomao, paying no mind to it, opened up an old wicker trunk. There were a few sets of tasteless clothes she got from a second hand shop previously. She thought these would be much better than being covered in dirt, and it was that moment someone beat at her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It turned out to be Zilin. Chou’u had grown up, but Zilin had grown a lot too. The girl was still treated as a kamuro, but at this rate, in two years even, she would be taking in clients.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What’s the matter?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The girl was the goldfish poop that always stuck behind Chou’u.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Zilin looked like she had a lot to say, but she was mute. She could hear, but she couldn’t speak. Maomao heard the girl had never spoken since she was born. There could be some abnormalities with her throat from birth, or she lost the ability to speak from an illness or an injury before she could learn how to speak.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As a herbalist, Maomao would like to find out what caused it, but that would be difficult since it wasn’t her field of expertise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Zilin brought over a box filled with sand.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Chou’u has been acting strange lately&lt;/em&gt;,” the girl wrote. It seems she had been taught to write to make up for her inability to speak.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Does he act like that to people aside from me?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I don’t mean that.&lt;/em&gt;” Zilin groaned, at a loss for how to write it. “&lt;em&gt;He’s obsessing over it&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Over what?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Zilin eagerly took out a book from her bosom pocket. The book was covered in finger marks from being read many times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;He has been acting strange ever since he read this book&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Is that so?”&amp;nbsp; Maomao tapped the girl on the head. “I’m going to borrow this.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Okay.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao took the book.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was titled: ‘The Villainess of the North’.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: Zilin = Zuurin, but now more faithful to the Mandarin reading.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Going by this chapter, I&amp;#8217;m hazarding that this arc seems to be about Maomao dealing with the fallout from the revelation of Kokuyou&amp;#8217;s true nature, and the ramifications of Chou&amp;#8217;u coming to terms to what happened to the Shi clan&amp;#8230; so I&amp;#8217;ll temporarily dub this arc &amp;#8220;Dealing with the Repercussions&amp;#8221;, or just Repercussions because one word titles are best. I will change it later. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Otherwise other possible translation that are truer to the literal meaning of the word: &amp;#8220;Dealing with the aftermath&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Setting things right&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Picking up the pieces&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Cleaning up the mess&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Tying up loose ends&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Settling the matter/problem&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Straightening things out&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Making up for mistakes&amp;#8221;  &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Hard to judge if the title is going for the positive or negative sense right now.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Knowing Boar, probably both.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;So far, I&amp;#8217;m leaning towards &amp;#8220;setting thing right.&amp;#8221;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Gosh does this sound like the title of a final arc&amp;#8230;. &lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;But why am I thinking so hard about this? In the long run, the best translation doesn&amp;#8217;t matter too much, since the only version that matters in the end is Kevin&amp;#8217;s anyway 🙂&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-02-the-story-of-the-villainess/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-01-older-brothers-care/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5521-6905976bad1ed' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5521&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5521-6905976bad1ed' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5521-6905976bad1ed' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-01-older-brothers-care/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

Smallpox arc. Looks like the long wait is going to be worth it.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Wanwan is actually Wang Wang (王旺), but I feel the former works better in this case. Also sounds like woof woof, so I&amp;#8217;ll be keeping the Japanese reading for his name.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/13-16-the-imperial-prince-and-his-wet-nurse/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Half a month after the emperor’s operation finished with no mishap, Maomao settled back into a workflow that consisted of half her usual work and half dosage experiments. A high-ranking court physician had taken over the emperor’s post-operative treatment. Although the scale of the dosage experiments have been reduced, the fact that they were keeping on with it was probably in the anticipation that it would prove useful here on after.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With the seasons getting colder, she also changed her medical robes to something thicker. The bedding for the patients in the town clinic would be supplemented with something a little thicker too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Wanwan-senpai, are the medicines for restocking okay here?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao passed the account book to the tall senior, otherwise known as Wanwan-senpai.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s fine. For some reason I feel like you’ve been excessively calling me by my name lately.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is that so?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Also, I feel like the way you’re pronouncing it is a little peculiar.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Could it be your imagination?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Wanwan. Written as Wang Wang.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was a name that Maomao, who was bad at remembering names, was super thankful for. It can’t be helped she pronounced it with fondness in her tone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Alright, now place the order of medicine for me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Understood. Also, I will be returning to the imperial court this afternoon. Is there anything you want me to take care of?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Mmm. Nothing for now. Now that you mention it, you’re checking the medicine room today, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Wanwan-senpai checked the medicine stock inventory as Maomao did, so he knew whose turn it was.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then, if Tianyu is in the area, get a rise out of him for me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“For sure.” Maomao replied, head held high.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Tianyu was the one who made the biggest mess during the emperor’s surgery, which had been a terrible challenge. It would have been fine if his blunder was from extreme stress, but in his case, it was for his personal reasons, so he had no grounds for extenuating circumstances. Tianyu was the one at fault for bringing personal interest into a job that concerned the life of the emperor. Rather, the fact that he didn’t lose his head over this was an act of clemency.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He received quite the pay cut, but the remainder was a freeloader&amp;#8217;s food expenses, so you could say that he was unpaid.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And so, Tianyu will be working without pay for the time being. Not only that, he was now punished with every single court physician out to drive him crazy.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even if they did get a rise from him, Tianyu was aloof by nature. Getting Tianyu to feel vexed became the biggest thing among the court physicians.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whether it would be called bullying or not…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Far from getting discouraged, the person himself was even having a great time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;　&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And so, Maomao returned to the imperial court.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Her junior Yo was in the medicine room. She would replenish the stock when Maomao and the others were away.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Maomao-san, I just replenished the stock, so check, please.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Okay.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The clever junior diligently learnt the fundamentals. Furthermore, she wasn’t conceited and would wash the bandages and sheets and disinfect the tools.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s wonderful that she does the fundamentals properly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;No matter how clever they were, if they don’t listen to people, they were of bad character. And then a person of bad character showed up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Hey, Niangniang and Yo. In the middle of work?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was Tianyu.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao thought about ignoring him, but she remembered what Wanwan-senpai told her. “Yes, Tianyu-san. Your cheeks are gaunt. Have you been eating properly?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. I’ve had food from Court Physician Liu’s place.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Liu, thinking that he couldn’t let Tianyu run loose, took on the responsibility to feed him, but as expected, he was impossible to tame.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even Maomao knew very well that agitating Tianyu would be difficult. Which is why she used a special tool.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is that so?” Maomao took out a large basket. Inside the basket was…&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“M-my word!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A large chicken. It has been decapitated, feathers plucked and blood drained. It was a spent hen that couldn’t lay eggs anymore, not a young chicken, but that was why it would have good flavour. It would be very delicious simmered well into a thick soup with an addition of egg and kudzu powder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao, who often went into town for work, had been entrusted with buying supper as well. If she made soup in the medical office and brought it back, the court physicians would be grateful to her and she would also save on dinner expenses–one stone two birds.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, it wasn’t the soup that Tianyu was jumping at.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ahhhh, I beg you. Please, Niangniang. Can’t you let me dismantle that chicken?” Hands dramatically on his cheeks, his normally dull fish-like eyes were sparkling.　&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Liu understood. A pay cut alone wouldn’t make Tianyu repent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The thing that would distress this guy would be…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Not letting Tianyu do his favourite dissections.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He messed up on the surgery, so for the time being, he was banned from surgeries. Not only that, he wasn’t allowed to dissect dead bodies or dismantle animals.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He had no money, so he couldn’t buy meat from the markets either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Occasionally, when his withdrawal symptoms arose, they would just give him a bullfrog.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ahhh, I beg you. I&amp;#8217;ll process it well, so let me dismantle iiit.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No way.” Normally, she would save time and let him do it, but today she will continue to tease him. “Ahhh, come to think of it. I need water. I’ll have to fill up this water jug.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I’ll do it for you. Please, I beg youuu.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After teasing him, he drew water and did the laundry for her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As work finished early, Maomao did side jobs in the medical office. Yo did the same. She sat down next to Maomao and rolled up the washed bandages.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the next room, Tianyu, who had finally acquired the chicken to dismantle, displayed his magnificent knife skills. He followed the muscle and divided it up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll be using the thigh meat for stir-fry, so please cut it into bite-sized pieces. Please boil the bones in the pot together with spring onion.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Okaaay.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao will do the seasoning. Her colleague En’en was better at cooking, but she wasn’t here today, so it can’t be helped.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is this fine? Didn’t Court Physician Liu put a stop to it?” Yo whispered to Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t give him bait once in a while, he would try to dismantle a nearby person sooner or later, wouldn&amp;#8217;t he?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;There’s no way.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, he will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Tianyu was this dangerous. Hence why you need to know how to take control of his reins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Please remove the scum properly,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Got it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While such an exchange occurred, the old court physician showed up. “Oh, what is today’s supper?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s egg drop soup,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Oh hoh. You want wood ear mushroom?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Please give me if you have.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The old court physician took out a dried black item from the medicine box. This shrewd court physician purchased herbal medicine that can be used as condiments or ingredients. His excuse was that maintaining the health of court physicians was also a splendid job.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While Maomao reconstituted the wood ear in hot water, she added wine and salt and then seasoned it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The chicken stir-fry was haphazardly made with whatever vegetable was available.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Court Physician-sama. Can we cultivate a field?” Maomao asked the old court physician.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao wanted to cook with freshly picked herbs like green spring onions and garlic chives. And if possible, she also wanted to grow a lot of herbal medicines.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No can do. There was a case before where a court lady who had been entrusted to manage the field made a blunder.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You’re right,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He was talking about Suirei. Having plotted Jinshi’s assassination, she was now not allowed to exist.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As the old court physician’s nose twitched, he read a note.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The child over there is Yo, correct?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;hm, can you come over for a moment?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What is it?” Yo asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He showed Yo, not Maomao, the journal. Curious, Maomao also came over.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The note was from a court physician working in another region.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;This is.” Yo’s complexion changed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, things might be getting a little scary.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In the note, it was written that there has been an increase in patients who were breaking out in blisters.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: People have been asking about what Tianyu did during the surgery. The details are in LN15, but essentially, he refused to do his job when it was his time to step up.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-02-chitchat/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-01-chicken-meat/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-4935-6905976bcbc66' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=4935&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-4935-6905976bcbc66' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-4935-6905976bcbc66' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-01-chicken-meat/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

The reason the surviving members of the Shi clan were raised in secrecy. This would prevent the emperor&amp;#8217;s sentencing from being perceived as lenient and keep the children under surveillance, so they would not contemplate avenging their parents.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Chou’u was the only one among the children who lost his memories as a side effect of the resurrection drug. Half his body was also paralysed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was for that reason Chou’u was the only one living separately in the pleasure district.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao opened the book she borrowed from Zilin. “The villainess of the north, huh?” she said, flipping through the pages.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was a story common on the streets about &lt;em&gt;Loulan&lt;/em&gt;, the villainess of the north.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The story was about a former consort abandoned by the late emperor who had controlled her daughter and attempted to bring down the country.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The general idea isn’t wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, the villainess &lt;em&gt;Loulan&lt;/em&gt;’s depiction and lines just felt wrong. No, perhaps Maomao just didn’t know this &lt;em&gt;Loulan&lt;/em&gt;: a haughty and domineering consort from the book? It seems the writing had greatly exaggerated the rumours.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was written that the late emperor did not pick &lt;em&gt;Shenmei&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Loulan&lt;/em&gt;’s mother—to sleep with, having discovered her true nature. Setting &lt;em&gt;Shenmei&lt;/em&gt;’s personality aside, the real reason was different. It seemed to her the late emperor have been romanticised to some extent as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The contents might have been written with censors in mind, seeing how real names were used.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;People would normally get angry when their friends get depicted in a bad light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, that was the kind of performance &lt;em&gt;Loulan &lt;/em&gt;enacted. On the contrary, the more of a villain &lt;em&gt;Loulan &lt;/em&gt;was in the story, the more it felt like her intentions had been reached. If anything, &lt;em&gt;Loulan &lt;/em&gt;would be pleased if she were to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shenmei &lt;/em&gt;was more the hopeless villain to Maomao, but &lt;em&gt;Loulan &lt;/em&gt;was the one fully treated as the villain in both rumours and this book.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At the end of the scuffle, she injured the imperial brother’s face.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only this part is clearly fictional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As she had injured the face as beautiful as a celestial maiden, it made her the most evil woman of all. The reason being that he was the most beautiful was clichéd too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;With all that said, it had to be a worthwhile read, seeing how it had been passed around and read to the point of getting dirty. Maomao would probably find it interesting if she were an unrelated party.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao closed the book, changed out of her dirty clothes from working in the fields, then headed over to Verdigris Mansion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The brothel was getting ready for opening, so the women were moving about busily.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao called out to Sazen who was closing up shop. “Where’s Chou’u?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“He went home just before,” he answered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, after that.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sazen seemed to have noticed something from Maomao’s expression. “Did something happen?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Is this book popular?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sazen’s face darkened. He was one of the people who knew of Chou’u’s situation. “Shall we talk while I close up?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sure.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao and Sazen went inside the apothecary. The inside was cluttered as he had been in the middle of tidying up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He makes medicine conscientiously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;While he lacked creativity, he diligently kept to what he had been taught. It was both Sazen’s strong and weak point. As things were done the same way, Maomao helped with cleaning up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Did Chou’u get his memory back?&amp;#8221; Maomao asked as she checked the medicine left on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ve no idea about that. Just that he normally hates studying and yet this book alone he’s read completely.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It would be troubling if he recovered his memory. The special treatment was taken on the assumption that he had no memories. You could even call it an act of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“There’s no way he’d answer simply if you press him, yeah. Is he rebellious against you too, Sazen?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“He’s not that strong against me. But he’s at a difficult age and I’m afraid he’ll soon surpass me in height and I’ll lose to him.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You won’t lose.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even if he grew taller, he would still have his paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll also ask Ukyou to have Chou’u’s monitoring strengthened, would that be fine?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t ask me. Above anything else, if he does anything strange, I’ll report it immediately, so—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Don’t make Chou’u the enemy of the emperor.” Sazen peeked at Maomao’s expression. Chou’u may be a cheeky brat, but Sazen had some degree of fondness for the child.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even Maomao thought that simply disposing of him would be irresponsible. “Spare me from such a bothersome thing. Above all, that would break the promise.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The promise? I see,” Sazen said in a curiously understanding tone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao didn’t think she told Sazen who that promise was made with, but it sounded like he was pretending to know. She decided to let it go, thinking that he must have heard it in passing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Next, can I talk about what’s bothering me about this book?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What about it?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sazen flipped through the book. “The author wrote this for the mass market, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, it’s just like the rumours.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But this right here.” He pointed to a certain description.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was written that the many tortures ordered by Loulan made her a villainess.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But it was her mother who did the torturing… hm?” Maomao tilted her head.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“See, isn’t it strange?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s strange.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;All of Shenmei’s deeds had become Loulan’s.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Actually, all of the tortures were done inside the fortress.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Really?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t know, but the details about the fortress are strangely consistent too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So you’re saying that the author of this book is related to the Shi clan?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sazen nodded.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In that case, she also understood why they avoided the censors. It must have been to protect their identity,&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Since you are here, Sazen, it’s not strange that other people have escaped.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Above all, it was none other than the villainess herself who freely handed out money, blew up the gunpowder, and had the menservants escape from the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Moreover, was there any among the menservants producing gunpowder skilled enough in writing to pen this story?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“More than anything, do they have a reason to go so far as to write this story and risk exposing their identity?” Maomao groaned as she pulled out the medicine box drawer. The stock for brown sugar was quite low. “You didn’t give Chou’u brown sugar as a snack, right?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No way. He would sneak some from time to time, though.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew it&lt;/em&gt;, Maomao closed the drawer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s no wonder he read this book so intently, then. There were other similar books, but he skimmed through those.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao looked at the last page of the book. The author’s name was more common than Kan Junjie: Chou San. She doubted it was their real name.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As it was handwritten, there was no print shop seal either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A thorough measure against censors, huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Any idea as to who the author could be?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No idea. I think there were hundreds of people at that fortress.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That’s true.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Anyway, if Chou’u does anything unusual, I’ll notify you immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Thanks.” Maomao picked up the book and left the apothecary. After asking the madam where the book came from, she had to return to the dorms.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only I could get time off freely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Not getting that was the tough part about being a salaried worker.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: The name Chou San is the Japanese reading for 张三 (Zhang San). Just like 李四 (Li Si) and 王五 (Wang Wu), these names are as generic as they get. Might as well be anonymous haha&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-03-peach-blossom-bookstore/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-02-the-story-of-the-villainess/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5538-6905976bcacf2' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5538&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5538-6905976bcacf2' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5538-6905976bcacf2' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-02-the-story-of-the-villainess/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.05 The Interview&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-04-the-late-shift/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A civilian doctor knowledgeable in smallpox. Kokuyou was the only one Maomao knew of.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A young man with half his face scarred by smallpox, and an easy-going personality that thought nothing of his unfortunate past.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That was the person Maomao sent the letter to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;em&gt;Ahhh, I’m &lt;/em&gt;coming&lt;em&gt;! Yayyyy&lt;/em&gt;!&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She got a really simple reply. Just as imagined.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This was the man who had a criminal record of attempting to take the court lady exam while in drag. If you invited him over from the other side, no way was he going to turn down the opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although, his reply came attached with a letter from Sazen.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sazen-san, is the person currently working at the apothecary, right?” Yo looked at the letter with a tilt of her head. It was much thicker than the letter from Kokuyou.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The two of them checked the contents. To summarise the letter that was brimming with sadness, inviting sympathy, it was: “Don’t take Kokuyou away!” There were tear-stains on the paper. You could believe it was a petition letter offered up by a wife to stop her husband from going to war.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“When did he become Doctor’s wife?” Yo asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Beats me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was unknown whether Yo was serious or joking.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Kokuyou himself was on board with it, so he will be coming at once.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The interviewers were her dad, Luomen, Court Physician Liu, the old court physician, and one other high-ranking court physician.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The old court physician decided to take the opportunity to see Kokuyou before he went back.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As his referees, Maomao and Yo were on clerk duty in the corner of the room.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou was smiling foolishly like always. His attire was slightly better than usual because he had removed the cloth that covered half his face when he sat before the interviewers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He looked more striking with the scars on his handsome face.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’m Kokuyou. Pleased to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I heard you’re knowledgeable in treating smallpox. How about it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it was Court Physician Liu who proceeded with the talks.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Exactly so. My master inoculated me with pus from a smallpox patient. I developed smallpox, it got worse, and I turned out like this. I was really lucky that I didn’t die.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As always, this man spoke of unfortunate things bluntly.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Do you mean the symptoms worsened after infection control measures were implemented?” Luomen asked to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, I had a younger twin brother. My master wanted to see what happens when you inoculate twins raised in the same environment with different pus. We were infected on purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was human experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although Maomao did such things as well, it wasn’t to the extent of Kokuyou’s master.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“And the result?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“My symptoms worsened and my younger brother just got a mild fever.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Where was the pus that inoculated your younger brother sourced from?”&lt;br&gt;“Where is your master now?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The court physicians’ interests shifted from the interview to the experiment Kokuyou had undergone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“My master died. I’m in a fix since he didn’t leave behind his research materials.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then, does your younger brother know?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“My younger brother also died. When he saw my pockmarked face, he was so shocked he stabbed our master. That was the reason no materials were left behind. Afterwards, my younger brother hung himself out of remorse.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brutal…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She heard that his master died, but it was much more brutal than she imagined.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Yo’s face had paled. The court physicians were also put off. Only Luomen looked at Kokuyou sadly.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It was over ten years ago. I’ve been studying my master’s research the entire time, but it’s quite the undertaking. Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve brought the materials of my research relating to epidemics.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Liu wordlessly accepted the materials and looked through them. He also showed it to Luomen and shared it with the other court physicians.&amp;nbsp; Despite his flippant way of speaking, his materials seemed legit–in particular, the old court physician nodded many times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m curious…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao thought about having Kokuyou show them to her later as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;She suddenly looked at Yo, who was hanging her head with a pale face. Maomao shook the other court lady’s shoulders. “Our clerk duty isn’t done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“R-right.” Yo flusteredly moved her brush.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What is this ‘lifetime immunisation’?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It is a phrase my master used occasionally. It means not contracting the disease for the rest of your life after contracting it once. I suppose I used a phrase translated from the language of my master’s country.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Can you assert this to be true?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I cannot, but I have inoculated myself with pus every three years and haven’t developed the disease. Also, I have not heard of anyone contracting the disease again after contracting it once at the smallpox village despite several outbreaks. I believe if you increase the parameters, exceptions would also increase, but to my knowledge, it is generally the case that after getting it once, you won’t get it again.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It seems the views of the four court physicians aligned.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Would it be alright if we copy your materials?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou didn’t reply, all smiles.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We’ll pay you fifty silvers.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sure,” Kokuyou said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this man had good money sense.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Also, in terms of employment, it will not be at the imperial court. You will be going to the countryside. Would it be alright even if the stay becomes long-term?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou was all smiles again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We’ll pay you two silvers per day.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou did not move.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;How about two silvers and a half, no, three silvers?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Still no movement.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Fine&lt;/em&gt;. Five silvers!”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was extremely generous.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou finally nodded.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I-is that okay? I think five silver is on par with the treatment of a high-ranking court physician, though.” Yo, becoming concerned, shook Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“With you being an irreplaceable talent, we will give you this much. If this was a commodity, it could rise ten times, a hundred times in value.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But with Court Physician Liu as the other party, they won’t be bullish,&lt;/em&gt; Maomao thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then, five silvers.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is he trying to raise it even higher?&lt;/em&gt; she thought.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Kokuyou lifted three fingers. “No need for five silvers. I’ll be happy with three. Also, can you prepare a carriage to get me there and provide me with sleeping quarters and food separately?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we’ll prepare that for you as much as you like.” The court physicians stroke down their chests in relief.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After the interview was over, Maomao and Yo were entrusted to guide Kokuyou. It was to hand him his court physician robes and the bare minimum of tools before he went to his work posting.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Fufufu, it’s good fortune that I was able to get a government job. We’ll be together, Yo,” Kokuyou said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’m also happy that I will be with Doctor, but it’s not a fun workplace.” Yo’s face paled.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“How is it at the posting now?” Maomao wanted to ask in detail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“We get around one to two patients per day as of now. But the village itself has been locked down, so the mood is bad. The frustration grows by the day,&amp;#8221; Yo replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yo hasn’t personally examined a patient yet, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, I’ve been told that I will be going as Court Physician Lao’s assistant.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;That’s right. The old court physician was Court Physician Lao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Even Maomao remembered the name of the boss of her posting. More than anything, she remembered names that were easy to remember like Wanwan-senpai, but she just ended up calling Court Physician Lao the old court physician, taking the name Lao (老) for the meaning of old.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Once the number of workers is secured, I might be entering the village as well,&amp;#8221; Yo said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;If you don’t want to, you don’t have to do it,” Maomao said honestly.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, I believe it is possible because it is me. The things that I can do that Maomao-san can’t are limited, after all.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then it’s fine.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The court lady wasn’t scared of just the epidemic. The frustration of the oppressed residents would fall onto the court physicians on site.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“My dad told me he will be coming with me. He’s eager since the pay is good too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Yo’s family had taken care of the surviving children of their village and moved to the capital. It might represent a golden opportunity to earn food expenses.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Come to think of it, Kokuyou, are you good with three silvers as your pay?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yup. It’s much higher than the sum I get for showing my face at the apothecary in the pleasure district,” Kokuyou said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sorry &lt;em&gt;for the low pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao gave him a stiff smile.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sazen will probably manage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Sazen just had low self-esteem. He wasn’t bad as a herbalist. However, he had a part of him that didn’t forgive failure. Since the effectiveness of medicine was determined by individual differences, there was no need to brood over it. Just that he will have to manage when it came to recognising the time to quit when the medicine wasn’t a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“But five silvers, huuuh? Court Physician Liu, was it? He’s a good doctor,” Kokuyou said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“He’s an outstanding doctor. Just strict,&amp;#8221; Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Court Physician Liu was on par with Luomen, a noted doctor of Li.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“He may be strict, but I’m happy that he seriously appreciated me. Among them some worked me hard for an entire day for a few coppers. He even gave me fifty silvers to copy my materials. I’ll have to do a good job. I need to treat the people who appreciate me right.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then, what about people who didn’t appreciate you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll treat them in the way they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was oddly deep, so Maomao decided to not ask any more deeply. “I don’t think you were worked that hard, though.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll demand a wage increase to five silvers when the time comes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That’s only if you succeed in getting that increase.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That might be difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In other words, he will be getting busy.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The materials just now, can you show it to me too?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The materials were also approved by high-ranking court physicians. It possessed that much value.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Sure, but can you pay me fifty silvers?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Ugh.” That was two to three months of Maomao’s salary. “Can’t you give me a friend’s discount?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Let me think about it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His haggling is actually on par with Rahan&lt;/em&gt;, Maomao thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-06-dining-hall/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-05-the-interview/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5011-6905976bda482' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5011&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5011-6905976bda482' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5011-6905976bda482' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-05-the-interview/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.19 Health Check&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-18-random-attacker/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;By some stroke of luck, Maomao was at Jinshi’s palace.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, yes, you must not have had dinner yet. I have it prepared.” Suiren started to lay out the meal like she was very much her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;There was a generous spread of dishes Maomao wanted to eat immediately, but she had to mind her manners. Not only was she not the head of the house, she was in the presence of an imperial. There was no way she could casually dig in.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although she often ate first as the food taster, from what she could tell from the table setting, she was being told to join him in his meal.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi slurped a mouthful of congee. “&amp;#8230;You can eat.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been waiting!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Having received Jinshi’s approval, Maomao helped herself to some congee. The broth was rich with a chicken flavour and there were floating bits of rice and meat.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi studied Maomao as he took a sip of the aperitif. “How has work been lately?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao swallowed the food in her mouth. “No changes for me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Nor for I.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nor for I, huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As for Maomao, she meant that there were changes for Yao, En’en, and Yo, but there was no need for her to go out of her way to correct it. He would probably tell her that he didn’t ask about her personally.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi looked like he wanted to say something but didn’t know how to bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t have to force yourself to speak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao ate in silence as she recalled that she was officially here to give the imperial brother a health check. She chewed and gulped down a juicy soup dumpling, then set down her chopsticks. “Jinshi-sama, you look well.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;He would usually look exhausted from overwork, but it didn’t seem to be the case today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I did acquire a subordinate whom Maomao hates to decrease my workload,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Hahaha, if you mean the man with Hu in his name, how about we stage an accident and dispose of him for the sake of the future?” Maomao hated Hulang.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Stop, stop. As it is, Chue would try to take his life if she has the opportunity to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go, Chue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao picked up her chopsticks and went for the pickled vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Besides, that one is useful for all sorts of intelligence,” Jinshi added.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is that sooo? What a pity.” She crunched on some pickles.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You also look well, Maomao.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The most stomachache-inducing work is over.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is that so? Has there been anything out of the ordinary?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Come to think of it, I did get a letter from an inner palace friend.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Your friend&amp;#8230;that would be, the girl who attended the learning centre?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes, you remember her.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Was Xiaolan finding what she learnt at the learning centre helpful in her current day-to-day life?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So she learnt her words well enough that she could send a letter.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes. However, I can never send her a reply because she forgets to put in her address.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Jinshi rubbed his chin. “Shall I look into it then?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“No, please leave it.” Maomao drank some tea.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Why is that?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I will send her a reply. I will have to write, ‘Don’t contact the pleasure district. It’ll give rise to strange rumours,’ and end it there.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Normally people don&amp;#8217;t send letters to a brothel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Wouldn’t it be fine if you prepare a different addressee?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Wouldn’t that give Chue-san more work?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was enough that Xiaolan was happy. Getting her involved with Maomao would probably get her monitored. Her letters would be inspected and her replies to Maomao would become bland. For Xiaolan to live in peace, the correct answer was for Maomao to not get into contact with her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao had too many things she couldn’t speak about, like the emperor’s surgery and smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, at the same time, she felt like she was doing Xiaolan a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao didn’t want to send a reply because she wanted to know about Xiaolan’s ordinary days. Until the day Xiaolan gives up on writing letters to her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“&amp;#8230;Has Jinshi-sama heard anything about smallpox?” Even with Jinshi, Maomao had to be careful with her words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Hulang is looking into smallpox currently. You don’t know the infection source of smallpox, is that right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The court physicians have a tacit understanding that their conversations would contain things they couldn’t readily talk about. Jinshi, taking that into account as well, said the words &lt;em&gt;infection source&lt;/em&gt;. “I heard a man called Kokuyou is under suspicion. They say that he had spread smallpox by purposely infecting children with it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“So you know this much.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Is that guy the culprit?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao shook her head. “Although it is within his capabilities, he has no reason to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Then who could the culprit be?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“May I offer my speculation?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“It’s not speculation, but a deduction.” Jinshi’s face was like their inner palace days when he wanted to order her to solve the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao crossed her arms. &lt;em&gt;How rude&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. “They are going after children to inoculate them with smallpox. Their actions look the same as Kokuyou’s, but there is a point of difference.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What is this difference?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Kokuyou does it when the children are healthy so the disease doesn’t aggravate. However, the culprit attacks unknown children. Also, being a random attacker, they would not be able to watch its development.” Maomao spoke like she was sorting out her mind. “&amp;#8230;It feels like a half-baked imitation.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What do you mean by imitation?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Imitating a doctor, perhaps? It feels like a child&amp;#8217;s game of make-believe where they only copy what they see and do not understand what they are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“A game of make-believe, huh? Then you mean, someone is doing the treatment to prevent smallpox, but they failed since they only learnt by imitation… “&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“That is what I think, but I do not think there is such a person who knows about that smallpox treatment. Besides, it seems like most of the residents of the village that Kokuyou treated have died… Hm?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Come to think of it, I think I was told something like there was one adult survivor from that village.” Maomao slapped her brow. She had a feeling Yo told her this, but the memory was vague. “You might know if you ask the court lady by the name of Yo.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao had a feeling Yo said something. She crunched on more pickles. It was perfectly salted, a flavour that made her want to eat it all.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“However, what kind of person is this Kokuyou you talked about earlier?” Jinshi asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jinshi has never met him, huh?&lt;/em&gt; Maomao thought. She would meet all sorts of people day in and day out, so she nearly forgot who knew who. “He’s a man with half of his face covered in smallpox scars. He’s overly cheerful, but his medical knowledge is solid. Also, he’s quite stingy.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Medical knowledge, huh? It looks to me he’s not a court physician.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Correct. He’s a stray doctor. He’s moved around a lot, perhaps due to his misfortunate nature. Come to think of it, he’s asked a lot about horses and cows lately.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Horses and cows? Is this related to the medical treatment?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I think it might be.” Maomao was also curious. “I am also curious, so when Kokuyou proposes something, may I come along as well?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“I’ll let them know.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Thank you very much.” Maomao bowed her head.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao and Jinshi had a bad habit of turning their conversations into work.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, it couldn’t be helped since they barely have any interests and hobbies in common.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Only that Jinshi enjoyed food from food stalls. It seems his tastes turn towards commoner fare.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Maomao reached for the noodles. This too, was delicious, rich in flavour. “Come to think of it, Chue-san told me there is a good knife-cut noodles stand.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Knife-cut noodles, stand.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was something that Jinshi could never have. The imperial brother had no way of eating leisurely at a food stand in town. He would have to borrow clothes off a manservant and erase his body scent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;However, for a jaunt around town like they did before, the scar on his right cheek was too conspicuous, and concealing it as a burn scar would also stand out too much.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Although everyone in the inner palace knew the eunuch Jinshi’s face, no one knew him in town back then.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Now that he was known in the capital as the imperial brother, there was no way he could casually dress up for a stroll around town.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Shall I ask if I can get takeaway?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“The noodles will get soggy and cold. Most importantly, it tastes better when you slurp the hot noodles when you’re out in the cold.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“You know very well how to eat it.” Maomao glanced at Suiren. There was no doubt this capable nanny practiced hard in knife-cutting noodles despite her old age. “Please summon for me when Suiren-sama cooks knife-cut noodles.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Got it, or rather, I’ll summon you over for other things too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As Maomao ate the last of the pickles, she thought, &lt;em&gt;I have to write a report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On that, “&lt;em&gt;The imperial brother is in good health&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-20-a-new-casualty/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-19-health-check/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5269-6905976be63f3' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20251101#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5269&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5269-6905976be63f3' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5269-6905976be63f3' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-19-health-check/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>
