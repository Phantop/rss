I wanted to preserve some sort of metre considering this is a song and the &amp;#8216;baby&amp;#8217; does keep the theme running&amp;#8230; Feel free to suggest something that flows better. Poetry isn&amp;#8217;t my strong suit.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Baby deer, baby deer&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little baby deer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat lots of grass, lots of nuts and berries;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when you grow big, run far, far away.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby deer, baby deer&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little baby deer.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tianyu was singing while plucking leaves from the stems. The leaves will be used for medicine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That song, what is it?” Maomao asked him as she rolled her shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ahh, my body feels stiff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While reflecting that it could have been due to her lying in a strange posture, she had a stem in her hand. Tearing the leaves off individually was a hassle, so she stripped the leaves in one go by running her fingers down the stem. As the thick stems had thorns, she had to double-check before she did so.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Tianyu should be doing the same, but instead, he was tediously picking the leaves off one by one.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hm? This song? It’s a nursery rhyme, nothing special,” he answered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Huh.” She didn’t ask out of any particular great interest. It just had an oddly good rhythm to it that made her ask–don’t get her wrong.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Wanna hear the second verse?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Not really.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Umm, the next verse is…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Baby boar, baby boar&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little baby boar&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eat lots of bugs, lots of bamboo shoots;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;And when you grow big, run far, far away.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baby boar, baby boar&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little baby boar.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So baby boar came after baby deer.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Deer and boar?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yeah, I come from a family of hunters, you see. These guys are really adorable when they’re tiny, but once they’re adults, they’re hateful and troublesome, so everyone says. We’re delighted, thanks to that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Deer and boar were pests, but at the same time, meat. The hunters must welcome them.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What does &amp;#8216;run far, far away&amp;#8217; mean?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a nursery rhyme, so the children sing it. They are hunted for meat when they fatten and grow up. That being said, they’re delicious as meat.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Huh. Is the third verse, bear?” Maomao recalled participating in bear dissections every so often.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Exactly so. Although the bear verse changes to us running away instead. Baby bears, as cute as they are, you can’t approach them. The mother bear is scary, after all.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Of course.” Maomao crushed the leaves that filled the basket. They would be washed, steamed, and then dried afterwards. “I wish they catch a lot of bear since their guts are valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Bear, huh… It’s now bear hunting season. Would they come out?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That would be nice.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao’s wish was granted in an unexpected way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A few days later, Maomao was in a forest. A high-ranking court physician suddenly told her to go and had her board a carriage.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What on earth will we be doing?” Changsha looked at Maomao anxiously.&amp;nbsp; Having been abruptly brought outside, the small junior who didn’t mince words was feeling uneasy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yao was another person with an uneasy expression. There was no En’en today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yao-san and Maomao-san are both dressed in worn-out clothes. There’s no way today’s work is shopping, right?” Changsha asked. The girl was clad in everyday wear instead of her usual white court physician robes. Although she had a coat on, it was something she had proudly bought recently, so it wasn’t appropriate in a forest.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for Maomao and Yao, they were both wearing dirty clothes. En’en would probably go crazy if she were to see Yao’s outfit.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’ll know soon enough,” Yao said curtly. It wasn’t that she was displeased by her shabby attire. There was just no time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Here, take this.” Maomao offered Changsha a coat that was almost rags from her belongings.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What?” Changsha made a face.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This too.” Maomao held out a shirt with tight sleeves. The shoes were also made from leather.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What are we actually doing?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Dissecting an animal.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao entered the forest after making Changsha change outfits. Yao followed after them with a pale face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Oh, you’re here.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wanwan-senpai came to greet them. Around him were seven new court physicians sporting the same uneasy look as Changsha.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is Maomao here to practice as well?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No, I’m giving guidance,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Same as me then.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He was the perfect guide for the new court physicians, being an outstanding middle-ranking court physician who was caring and attentive.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Some of the court physicians had the same bewildered look as Changsha, while others were pale-faced like Yao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The former must be first-timers to dissections, while the latter had probably been told to take supplementary lessons.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao looked at Yao. “Yao-san, you don’t need to force yourself to participate.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m not forcing myself,” Yao muttered. “It’ll be fine, it’ll be &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.” It sounded like she was reassuring herself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao let out a heavy breath. The air that came out was white and immediately dispersed. The base of her throat was cold, so she wrapped a towel around it. She took a set of blades out from her belongings.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Take these,” Maomao handed the blades to Changsha. They were a set of three knives of differing length and width—something less fragile than surgical scalpels. “These three knives are all you will be supplied with. If you need more, please purchase them yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao looked at Yao. The latter had a box with more than ten small blades with her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It would be better if you finish with just these three, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Surgery wasn’t like cooking. There was no time to select a tool during an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;En’en was probably the one who assembled the tools, not Yao. It was clear that the tools were an attempt to compensate for Yao&amp;#8217;s lack of aptitude.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What could today be?” Maomao headed over to the hunter’s cabin, which she visited many times.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“WHOA,” Changsha screamed out, either out of shock or fear.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a bear.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A bear was hanging from a tree. Its tongue was lolling out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I-IT&amp;#8217;S DEAD?!” a new court physician cried out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If it’s alive, we won’t be calling you out here in the first place. Come on. It’s time for work,” Wanwan-senpai replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hunters took the bear down from the tree and laid it on top of a large boulder to make it easier to cut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Lads, can we hurry with the processing? We don’t want the meat quality to drop any further. We’ve only just drained the blood from this specimen.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hunter’s words were reasonable. Normally, the organs were removed the moment the blood was drained to prevent the stink from permeating. He had purposely let the court physicians know and waited for their dissection.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Got it,” Wanwan-senpai said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;So that’s why it doesn’t stink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao’s nose twitched.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Blood barely had a smell when fresh. The worsening odour was due to decomposition. Blood was rarely a choice part for consumption probably from how easily it spoiled. When it came to fresh blood, she had heard before that it was tasty stuffed in sausages.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Covering the mouth with a towel couldn’t completely block out the stench.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was the end of the year. The season where it might snow, but it doesn’t, so insects were thankfully less active.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were pests like flies, but parasite activity was also inhibited. It was tough to keep in mind not bringing back fleas or ticks that have jumped onto you.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hunter cut open the bear, which was facing up and drained of blood, from its throat. After cutting the esophagus, he next sliced up from the anus.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ugh.” One of the new court physicians disappeared due to the stench of blood and organs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yao endured with bloodshot eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is Changsha doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Changsha’s complexion was bad, but not to the point of vomiting. The girl watched the dismantling without averting her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Perhaps to save on time, or because it was too much responsibility for one person, three people were in charge of the dismantling. It seemed messy, but they were skilled at taking out the organs without damaging them. One person diligently poured water, flushing away the blood to improve visibility.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The extracted organs were stuffed into a large pail. There were also organs tossed into a small pail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ll be taking these,” a blood-covered hunter said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Got it. We’ll borrow this place for the time being.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sure. Make sure to wash away the blood completely.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hunters carried away the bear that had been broken down into meat and pelt, as well as the small pail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The organ pieces left behind gave off a foul smell.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Now then, it’s our turn,” Wanwan-senpai said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“O-OUR TURN?!” a young court physician said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;His tone left no room for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao, accustomed to it, carefully laid out the organs on the boulder where they had done the dissection. “People with cuts on their hands, please refrain from touching blood or the organs. You will get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since it was cold, the parasites were suppressed, but they were inside wild animals all year round.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Those too scared to touch can go ladle water over or something.” Wanwan-senpai went over to the young court physicians. For a moment, the court physicians made looks of frustration, but two meekly went off to draw water.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao, while laying out the organs, tilted her head at the damaged sections. “Do they intend to eat those as a delicacy?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The missing cuts were probably in the small pail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It should be fine if they get cooked,” Wanwan-senpai said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That being said, it would be difficult for the teacher if there weren’t enough teaching materials.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Come to think of it,” he looked at the sky. “We’ll have to stay overnight at this rate. Would that be alright with you?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I am fine with that,” Maomao said. “How about you two? Should we reserve lodgings too?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Please.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sun would probably set while they received an explanation of the organs.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-06-baby-deer-baby-boar-baby-bear-2/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-05-baby-deer-baby-boar-baby-bear-1/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5614-697a826a96cd8' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20260128#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5614&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5614-697a826a96cd8' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5614-697a826a96cd8' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-05-baby-deer-baby-boar-baby-bear-1/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

As usual, the password is in the same place as the arc 10 password.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;s&gt;I should also mention that 11.10 has the most views out of all the chapters on this blog. As of today, it has 51k views, when the other chapters get an average of 15k views&amp;#8230; is it the power of frog?&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Finally got around to cleaning up the site, so arc 11 has been taken down like I was supposed to ages ago lol (I&amp;#8217;ll keep my portion of arc 10 up since Duchess&amp;#8217; chapters are still up)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4919 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/10/15/arc-10-password-locked/" target="_self" &gt;Arc 10 password&amp;nbsp;locked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/10/15/arc-10-password-locked/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-10-15T21:00:37+11:00"&gt;October 15th, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;LN12 is out in English, so I did my thing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the password? Find it in the discord server.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As is tradition when I take down chapters, the locked chapters have undergone a minor edit, polish, or rewrite depending on how much the original version bothered me. Chapters with major changes have an edited date on the top of the page. (I haven&amp;#8217;t gone through all the chapters yet.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4779 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-kusuriya-no-hitorigoto"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/05/18/caught-up-once-again/" target="_self" &gt;Caught up once&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2024/05/18/caught-up-once-again/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2024-05-18T01:09:14+10:00"&gt;May 18th, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hey, lookie, the menu has finally been edited. Took me only 5 month since the previous post to do so&amp;#8230; I also took the opportunity to change the site theme, since the previous one was starting to bother me for some reason. The new theme&amp;#8217;s limited colour options (black, black, or black!!!) is a little unfortunate, but still, it&amp;#8217;s pretty.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;New header image is Maomao, since she&amp;#8217;s Best Girl xD&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now for updates since the previous post:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The web novel translation is now up to date. You can read &lt;strong&gt;arc 10 chapter 28 &lt;/strong&gt;all the way to&lt;strong&gt; arc 13 chapter 16&lt;/strong&gt; here. Earlier chapters of arc 10 can be found at Duchess&amp;#8217; site.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Arcs 1 to 9, which was on Creative Novels, have been taken down since the light novel equivalents are officially released in English. &lt;s&gt;(I&amp;#8217;ll delete arc 9 in two-ish days, so people catching up better read fast haha)&lt;/s&gt; Arc 9 is gone too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, I am aware that the font colour for the KnH character page is whacked. I haven&amp;#8217;t figured how to change it with the new WordPress editor, so bear with the random black text for now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m going to hibernate until the next arc begins. Let me know when the next chapter drops, thanks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-4273 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/its-not-dropped/" target="_self" &gt;It&amp;#8217;s not dropped!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2023/12/05/its-not-dropped/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2023-12-05T04:31:14+11:00"&gt;December 5th, 2023&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;I figured I should clarify this. The menu needs updating. &lt;strong&gt;The Kusuriya webnovel translation has not been dropped&lt;/strong&gt;. Well, I did drop it three years ago (hence the dropped tag), and have only just resumed mid-September this year, so it hasn&amp;#8217;t been long. I&amp;#8217;ll get around to editing that drop down menu one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Anyway, arc 11 is finished, &lt;s&gt;and I&amp;#8217;m nearly done with arc 12. Arc 13 does not exist yet.&lt;/s&gt; Done with arc 12 as well, working on arc 13 now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If you want notifications for whenever I upload a new chapter, come join us on the discord server. The link can be found a few posts below this one&amp;#8211;to clarify, it&amp;#8217;s not the Reddit one.  Just note that there will be open spoilers for the latest chapter of the BG manga at least for the entire server (and for their respective channels, open spoilers for the latest LN volume/WN chapter, etc), so anime-only people, beware. Although, I doubt it&amp;#8217;d be much of an issue if you guys are here for the webnovel anyway.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Why are the new chapters not posted on Novelupdates? Arc 10 isn&amp;#8217;t finished yet, and I&amp;#8217;d rather not deal with scrapers and stuff like I did in the past. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, arcs 1 to 8 have been taken down from creative novels since the LN equivalents have been published. Arc 9 is the last one left on that site, and will be nuked the moment LN11 is released.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For&lt;strong&gt; people wondering about arc 10&lt;/strong&gt;, you can find it &lt;a href="https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/chapter-listing/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Duchess is translating that one. It&amp;#8217;s not finished yet. She&amp;#8217;s up to chapter 27 out of 35, but will be resuming soon enough. (I&amp;#8217;m not counting the MTL&amp;#8217;d chapters that had somehow found its way onto Novelupdates.) &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who are directly jumping in from the latest published LN translation&lt;/strong&gt; (LN9), you can continue from arc 9, which is equivalent to LN10 and LN11. Arc 10 is LN12, Arc 11 is LN13, and Arc 12 is LN14. There will be some differences, of course&amp;#8211;not as drastic as the earlier arcs, but there is notably less romance in the WN. LN scenes tend to be more fleshed out as well. (Also, I don&amp;#8217;t have anyone editing my translations, so I apologise if it&amp;#8217;s not as polished as the officials are.)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Hopefully, this clears up most of the questions people have been asking.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Edit: Wow, it&amp;#8217;s been a while since I last made a post on this site.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Edit 2: I eat my words. Arc 13 begins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3817 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/06/03/official-english-release-of-ln2-is-today/" target="_self" &gt;Official English Release of LN2 is&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/06/03/official-english-release-of-ln2-is-today/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-06-03T14:51:48+10:00"&gt;June 3rd, 2021&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Go and get it!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(also, a little notice that arc 2 has been nuked from creative novels, in case people are wondering why it&amp;#8217;s gone :&amp;#8217;D)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3783 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/ln11-releases-on-april-30/" target="_self" &gt;LN11 releases on April&amp;nbsp;30!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/04/14/ln11-releases-on-april-30/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-04-14T13:01:09+10:00"&gt;April 14th, 2021&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="708" height="1024" src="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91ksrh451hs.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3784" sizes="(max-width: 708px) 100vw, 708px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Way sooner than expected! And this should be roughly equivalent to the latter half of arc 9 of the webnovel version 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a limited edition that comes bundled with another drama CD. &lt;br&gt;It comes with three tracks: &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;1) Jade Palace Girls Talk &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao is having afternoon tea with Jade Palace attendants Infa, Gui&amp;#8217;en and Airan. Gui&amp;#8217;en sparks a girls talk session by asking, &amp;#8220;Was there anyone good at the garden party?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;2/3) The Mystery of the Sake Bottle&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao had been dismissed from being a palace lady at the inner palace and is now employed as Jinshi&amp;#8217;s personal attendant. She heads to the pleasure district with Jinshi and Gaoshun in tow, going after the mystery of the broken sake bottle that had been left behind by an enigmatic person at the side of a well at dawn. And there, she comes across&amp;#8230;?!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Cast: &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao: Yuuki Aoi&lt;br&gt;Jinshi: Takahiro Sakurai&lt;br&gt;Gaoshun: Tsuda Kenjirou&lt;br&gt;Rihaku: Takumi Yasuaki&lt;br&gt;Rahan: Kobayashi Chiaki&lt;br&gt;Quack Doctor: Ogata Mitsuru&lt;br&gt;Infa: Kamiyou Saeko&lt;br&gt;Gui&amp;#8217;en: Moriya Kyouka&lt;br&gt;Airan: Kawano Mari&lt;br&gt;Suiren/Honnyan: Nitta Kyousuke&lt;br&gt;Owner of Kujaku Brothel: Nakano Taisuke&lt;br&gt;A kamuro: Tadano Akari&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On a side note, yes, the webnovel has resumed. There are currently four chapters out as of today. It looks like we&amp;#8217;ll be looking into who will be succeeding as the next leader of the western capital. Will it be Gyoku&amp;#8217;ou&amp;#8217;s second son or his third son? Shall we cast lots? What is the prodigal first son up to, anyways?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The continuation of the translation has been picked up by Duchess. You can find it here: &lt;a href="https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://knhtranslations.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt; or on the kusuriya discord server.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&amp;#8230;There&amp;#8217;s actually a lot of things happening on discord, so do come visit when you can!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Also, if you&amp;#8217;re wondering what I&amp;#8217;m up to, I&amp;#8217;m part of the scanlation team that working on the GX version of the manga. I&amp;#8217;m still around, for better or worse hahahahaha&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3761 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/02/14/volume-1-of-the-ln-releases-today/" target="_self" &gt;Volume 1 of the LN releases&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2021/02/14/volume-1-of-the-ln-releases-today/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2021-02-14T08:45:55+11:00"&gt;February 14th, 2021&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You can find it in pretty much at any place that sells ebooks of English translated light novels 😀 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Technically it&amp;#8217;s another eight hours or so from now due to timezone differences, but I&amp;#8217;ve no time to do all this when it is actually released in the US, so now&amp;#8217;s the time, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Well, this is it, guys.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The light novel version of Kusuriya no Hitorigoto (Apothecary diaries) has been licensed by J-novel Club, and so, with the release of the first volume today (February 14th 2021), the first volume/arc of this translation will be taken down today per J-novel club&amp;#8217;s request.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It feels a bit bittersweet having worked on this project for so long, but it is what it is. The next volume will be taken down when the next official LN is published.  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div style="height:112px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wp-block-post post-3742 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-template-part"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/ln-volume-10/" target="_self" &gt;LN volume 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;div style="font-style:italic;font-weight:400;" class="wp-block-post-date has-small-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/ln-volume-10/"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2020-11-24T23:59:50+11:00"&gt;November 24th, 2020&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img width="707" height="1023" src="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/enkp5qduuaedhty.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3743" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;So, the author just revealed on twitter.

If anything, Maomao could say that the bear was primarily dissected for that part.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Maomao, why would you need a knife to get back the gallbladder?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao quickly hid the small dissection knife.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We were talking about lodgings, weren’t we?” he then said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, it sounds like they have arranged two rooms for us, a large one and a small one,” she answered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although they had no idea what the rooms would be like, they probably wouldn’t be shown to the stables, considering the sum of money the court physicians handed over to the hunters as recompensation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As much as I would like us to go right this instant, the dissection comes first,” he said&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We can’t go right now?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We can’t.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wanwan-senpai went on to identify the entrails while giving an explanation to the junior court physicians. A pale-faced Yao studied the organ parts with teary eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re better off quitting if it’s not for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was Yao’s weakness not to do so, but it was also her strength. Perhaps what Changsha had told her previously had left quite the impression on her, seeing as Yao had returned to her family home.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;And speaking of Changsha…&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Excuse me, can this be eaten later?” the junior asked while looking at the bear entrails.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When the entrails aren’t fresh, they have a strong stench and can’t be eaten,” Maomao replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Changsha’s brows drooped in disappointment. “Not even with ginger?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s because we don’t know what the wild bears have eaten,” Maomao said honestly. Apparently, human hair had been discovered in a bear dissected in the past.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That might be quite unpleasant.” Changsha had quite the nerves of steel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No wonder she’s been called over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Before Maomao could join in with the other court physicians on dissections, she had been faced with various issues. The biggest of those was that there was no precedent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Conversely, now that there was a precedent, it was probably easy to have Changsha participate.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When they finished examining the bear’s organs, they processed the useful parts. There was bear’s gall, a medicine sourced from bears, but its other parts also had uses.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I wonder if they could spare us some bear fat,” a court physician with relatively practiced hands said. He wasn’t a first timer, having participated several times before.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We had no agreement to obtain fat, but why do you ask?” Wanwan-senpai asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s nothing much. I just heard that applying it to your hair will help with hair growth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Really?” Wanwan-senpai was also interested.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It seems that when gentlemen pass a certain age, they end up becoming creatures concerned about their hair.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao splashed water onto the boulder after they had dealt with the innards. She scrubbed away at the smeared blood as she rinsed it off. It was so cold that her fingers were numb.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ugh.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yao and Changsha did the same, scrubbing away with straw. Yao’s hands were chapped. No matter how much she moisturised, her hands were bound to end up like that if she was washing up every single day.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You guys, wash up properly as well,” Wanwan-senpai said to the new court physicians. They joined in.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Among them, some remained sitting, still feeling unwell, and some refused to work, stating that cleaning wasn’t a job for court physicians.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yao, in her annoyance, was about to call out to the ones who weren’t washing, but Maomao slapped her on the shoulders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Let’s not,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why not?” Yao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Wanwan-senpai isn&amp;#8217;t blind.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Yao looked at Wanwan-senpai. As he was here on a teaching role, he had his eye on every detail. He was certainly looking out for the qualities of a court physician, but those who fail to do the work assigned to them would be ruled out. Did they not think that it would affect their future career prospects?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Then, how would he regard Yao?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;You could say that she didn’t have the aptitude for dissections, but would he acknowledge her determination to keep going despite that?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Qualities were important, but an attitude to confront their weakness was even more so. Otherwise, they would end up with good-for-nothings like Tianyu.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’ll head to the village once we’re done with cleaning up,” Wanwan-senpai announced.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao rubbed her numb hands as she puffed out a breath of white air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Please make use of this house.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hunter guided them to an unoccupied house. It was in pretty good condition, appearing to be the house of a villager who had left recently. There were four rooms, so there was plenty of space for them.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There is not enough bedding, so please use these as you see fit.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They were provided with animal furs. It was probably much preferable to sleeping on the prickly dirt floor.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao scowled at the hunter as she nudged Wanwan-senpai.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wanwan-senpai, getting the message, approached the hunter. “I’m grateful for the rooms, but I would like to chat about the matter of you taking away bear organ parts that differed from what we had agreed on.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’d be my younger cousin, not me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What?” Wanwan-senpai made a look of surprise. Maomao was surprised too. Was he not the hunter who took away the bear meat just now?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We’re all relatives in this village. Me and my cousin look alike, so we often get mistaken for one another.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;Sorry, you really do look alike,” Wanwan-senpai apologised genuinely. Turns out he wasn’t the hunter from before but another villager.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But they really do look alike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Setting Maomao, who wasn’t good at remembering people’s faces, aside, even Wanwan-senpai got confused.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come to think of it, the person we entrusted to arrange our lodgings looked alike, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The village wasn’t very open, so it might be that everyone was closely related and had similar faces.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“We have food if you want it,” the villager said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A share per the number of people here, please. It’ll be great if you could up the portions a bit.” Wanwan-senpai passed the villager a pouch of coins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Got it. Also, please don’t wander around at night. If you get attacked by an animal, no one can save you,” the villager said, then left the house.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s gotten chilly,” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Shall we get a fire going?” Maomao looked at the pile of firewood on the dirt floor. Did the original owners have intentions of returning? There was furniture left behind as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Changsha promptly fetched a fire starter, so Maomao prepared the straw.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’ll go draw water.” And Yao found a task she could do herself; taking a pail and going outside. &lt;em&gt;How really considerate of Wanwan-senpai to quietly go with her&lt;/em&gt;, Maomao thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Other people set up the firewood, looked for seating to make up for the insufficient chairs, or did nothing and idled around.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Food was brought in a little while later.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a soup made from vegetables and bear meat alongside a millet porridge. People were divided into two camps over the hearty and simple flavour based on preference.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a little bland.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I feel this much is perfect. I do have salt, though. Do you want some?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I do. Rather, your bosom pocket has everything, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Give me some too, please.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Me too, me too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m good with just the porridge.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As expected, the meat stiiinks.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If only I had brought ginger with me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Dinner came to an end amidst the varied conversations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao, Yao, and Changsha decided to sleep together in the smallest room. Although cramped, it contained a bed big enough for two people.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Furs enough for one person were laid out on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I will sleep on the floor,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No, &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;will,” Changsha said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Umm…” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao suggested her sleep on the floor since she didn’t mind it, but Changsha found it unacceptable as a junior.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There are furs, so don’t worry about it,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Likewise for you,” Changsha said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Umm…” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was out of the question for Yao, the sheltered young lady, so Maomao and Changsha continued their discussion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Umm… I can sleep on the floor,” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yao-san, you don’t have to worry about it,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, what she said,” Changsha said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“But, two people are meant to sleep on the bed, right? What would happen if En’en were to hear of it?” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;““…”” Maomao and Changsha exchanged glances.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sorry, but may I sleep on the floor?” Yao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I&amp;#8217;m sorry…” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;This was the result of weighing between sleeping on the same bed as the young lady, and having her sleep on the floor. Either would incur wrath, but sharing a bed with her would put their lives in danger.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes! I will be sleeping on the floor!” Yao was oddly proud about it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T/N: Happy New Year!&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(Next Chapter)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-06-baby-deer-baby-boar-baby-bear-2/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5623-697a84952474f' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20260128#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5623&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5623-697a84952474f' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5623-697a84952474f' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-06-baby-deer-baby-boar-baby-bear-2/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;15.04 A Big&amp;nbsp;Cat&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/15-03-peach-blossom-bookstore/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao may have had Xiongmao reserve an identical copy of the book and look into its copyist for her, but that would take time, too. She would like to keep an eye on Chou’u’s situation for a bit longer as well, but a problem just came up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Go see the Moon Prince,” Court Physician Liu said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Today.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She had to go give Jinshi his regular medical check-up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although she wasn’t as opposed as she was in the past, she was afraid that Jinshi would see right through her and uncover everything that was troubling her. That being said, she couldn’t refuse an order from Court Physician Liu, so off she went.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks always.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao bowed her head at the guards, then entered the room. They were the usual familiar faces, but she still had yet to learn their names.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi was swirling a cup with one hand while holding documents with the other. It was so warm in the room that it didn’t feel like winter. There was a long-pile rug laid out and a lap blanket draped over the daybed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’re here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao raised her head. Jinshi’s workload should have decreased, but it must have become a routine for him to bring work home. The cases didn’t look important either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I have come to give you a health check,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Got it,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao took out a notebook.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s that?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If I don’t make a record, it’ll be negligence. So I thought of adding more questions in addition to the palpation and such we’ve done up until now.” Maomao had thought about various things in her own way.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Pardon me.” She drew over to Jinshi, then pulled down his lower eyelids, and had him stick out his tongue for her. She took his pulse and listened to his heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“…”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao ignored the indescribable gaze on her and did her job. “And now, a question.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As usual, she would first check to see if he had any physical discomfort or abnormalities. She added the new questions as a supplement. “I would like to know what and how much you eat every day during your meals. The same goes for your fluid intake, including wine or water.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t remember&lt;em&gt; every single detail&lt;/em&gt;.” Jinshi eyed the ceiling in annoyance, but he was spared from thinking. Suiren sidled over and set down a notebook that recorded his daily meals.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Thank you very much,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I will also write the quantity in full detail from now on,” Suiren said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A rough estimate will just be fine.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The nanny was too capable. Maomao set the notebook aside, planning to copy it down later.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Next, how many times do you go to the toilet every day?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Toilet…” he trailed off.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Please tell me specifically how many times you defecate.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Defecate…” Jinshi froze.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Okaaay, Maomao-saaan.” Chue suddenly appeared. “You can’t go any further. You caaan’t.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why can’t I?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chue chastised Maomao, wagging her finger and shaking her head. “Everyone’s idol does not go to pick flowers.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;I just wanted to check his condition. Rather, you’ll die if you don’t release what needs to be released, no?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Aaaanyway, anymore of this topic is forbidden. If he feels anything out of the ordinary, the Moon Prince will tell you himself, or Suiren-sama wiiill.” Chue placed a chair behind Maomao and gestured for her to sit. “How about you two make small talk insteaad?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao didn’t really want to chat while she wasn’t clear about Chou’u and the author of the book in question.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Apparently, it wasn’t the case for Jinshi.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If there’s anything out of the ordinary, I’ll inform you myself. More importantly…” Jinshi signalled to Suiren with his eyes. “An interesting item appeared on the market, so I got my hands on one.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What could it be? &lt;/em&gt;Maomao wondered.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suiren brought over a small teapot. The details on this piece were exquisite. It looked like it would fetch a good price.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Behold.” Jinshi poured tea into a teacup. The tea leaves had a pleasant aroma. Was he using extremely expensive tea leaves?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He poured tea into another teacup. No, not tea. He was pouring red fruit juice into the teacup.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao compared the contents of the two teacups. They were each filled with a completely different liquid.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What do you think? Fascinating, right?” Jinshi smiled in amusement. “The inside of the teapot has a dual structure. You can pour out two different kinds of liquid.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ohh.” Maomao studied the teapot with great interest. “It can be used for poisoning.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;I guess so.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“From now on, if I see a similar teapot, I will take caution.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Do that.” Jinshi, looking a little depressed, pushed the teapot to the edge of the table.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was just trying to make conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao felt bad, but she couldn’t help thinking in the direction of a food taster.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is there to talk about?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Come to think of it, how are the children at A’duo-sama’s?” she found herself asking. Chou’u’s matter was probably still on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The surviving children?” Jinshi said. “How unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Zhizi-san has gotten much better, so it just came to mind.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hm. So the girl I left in your custody is growing up well.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, she’s very attached to Rahan’s older brother.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That gentleman does seem to be the type that children would get very attached to.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There were times the girl got near feral, but it was probably much preferable to being on the brink of death from malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Three years have passed since the incident,” Jinshi said. “The children are growing up well with barely any memories of their past. They’re also very attached to A’duo-dono.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao was also aware. It wasn’t just A’duo—Suirei was also looking after them properly.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the children will not be children forever.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What are the plans for the children in the future?” she asked. “Treating them like Suirei is out of the question, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Suirei, at the very least, descended from the late emperor. The monitoring of her will not ease for as long as she lives.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If there are no issues when they reach adulthood, we intend to let them all live independently. It seems they had been left entirely in the care of their wet nurses—their parents fell into depravity before they were old enough to be aware.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Chou’u was the oldest among the surviving children. He would have had to have more memories of his parents than the other children. If he were to recover his memories, how would he behave?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t remember. Don’t ever remember.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If he were to feel animosity, even Maomao wouldn’t be able to protect him.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;While drinking tea, deep in thought, her eyes fell upon Jinshi’s paperwork. There was a crude drawing among the complicated documents.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s this?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahh, Imperial Princess Lingli drew this for me. Apparently, it’s me,” Jinshi said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“While I can’t quite say it looks like you, it has character.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Right?” He lifted his chin in pride.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For a time, the imperial princess was more attached to Maomao than Jinshi, but she might have forgotten about Maomao already. Maomao studied the drawing while feeling a bit bitter.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“She’s six this year, right?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao only remembered her as a baby. Children grow up fast—the saying also came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ow.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao randomly jabbed Jinshi.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi leaned back in reflex. “Wh-what was that for?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nothing, I was just thinking that Jinshi-sama from four years ago would have never behaved like this.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahhhh. Stop. Stop talking about it. I don’t want to hear it.” Jinshi covered his ears and shook his head. It seems his past actions disturbed him.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It was a perquisite for palace ladies at the inner palace back then, wasn’t it? To have the opportunity to be greeted by the beautiful lordship who, by all rights, people would have difficulty seeing, even if it was for work,” Maomao said while recalling the sparkling figure.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Are you harassing me?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No, no, not at all. I was just amused by how much it contrasts with your current appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hmph.” Jinshi went to lie down on the daybed, sulking.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you are going to sleep, please do so in the bedroom.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi beckoned at Maomao wordlessly. When she came over, he rolled her up in the blanket nearby.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao got cocooned. “What are you up to?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi must have heard her muffled voice through the blanket. “I wanted to replenish to the point I don’t feel weird,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“This is such an indirect way.” Maomao wriggled, but she couldn’t break free from the tight wrapping.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You’re somewhat like a real cat.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“There’s no such cat this big.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Should I keep a tiger?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Who will look after it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Basen.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahh.” Maomao could see it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That’s irresponsible, so I’ll give it a miss.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Please do that.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Instead, I’ll have you act as the cat.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Uuu, woof.” Maomao will never ever meow.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time, she started to settle into her current position, feeling oddly warm and faintly aware of his heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve got to stay awake.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao lightly pinched her cheek while feeling the thumping.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;T/N: No new chapter yet, so this one is still the latest.

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.19 Health Check&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-18-random-attacker/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;By some stroke of luck, Maomao was at Jinshi’s palace.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, yes, you must not have had dinner yet. I have it prepared.” Suiren started to lay out the meal like she was very much her grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There was a generous spread of dishes Maomao wanted to eat immediately, but she had to mind her manners. Not only was she not the head of the house, she was in the presence of an imperial. There was no way she could casually dig in.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although she often ate first as the food taster, from what she could tell from the table setting, she was being told to join him in his meal.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi slurped a mouthful of congee. “&amp;#8230;You can eat.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been waiting!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Having received Jinshi’s approval, Maomao helped herself to some congee. The broth was rich with a chicken flavour and there were floating bits of rice and meat.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi studied Maomao as he took a sip of the aperitif. “How has work been lately?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao swallowed the food in her mouth. “No changes for me.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Nor for I.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nor for I, huh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As for Maomao, she meant that there were changes for Yao, En’en, and Yo, but there was no need for her to go out of her way to correct it. He would probably tell her that he didn’t ask about her personally.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi looked like he wanted to say something but didn’t know how to bring it up.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don’t have to force yourself to speak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao ate in silence as she recalled that she was officially here to give the imperial brother a health check. She chewed and gulped down a juicy soup dumpling, then set down her chopsticks. “Jinshi-sama, you look well.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He would usually look exhausted from overwork, but it didn’t seem to be the case today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yeah, I did acquire a subordinate whom Maomao hates to decrease my workload,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hahaha, if you mean the man with Hu in his name, how about we stage an accident and dispose of him for the sake of the future?” Maomao hated Hulang.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Stop, stop. As it is, Chue would try to take his life if she has the opportunity to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go, Chue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao picked up her chopsticks and went for the pickled vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Besides, that one is useful for all sorts of intelligence,” Jinshi added.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is that sooo? What a pity.” She crunched on some pickles.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You also look well, Maomao.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The most stomachache-inducing work is over.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is that so? Has there been anything out of the ordinary?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Come to think of it, I did get a letter from an inner palace friend.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;Your friend&amp;#8230;that would be, the girl who attended the learning centre?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes, you remember her.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Was Xiaolan finding what she learnt at the learning centre helpful in her current day-to-day life?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So she learnt her words well enough that she could send a letter.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes. However, I can never send her a reply because she forgets to put in her address.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi rubbed his chin. “Shall I look into it then?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No, please leave it.” Maomao drank some tea.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why is that?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I will send her a reply. I will have to write, ‘Don’t contact the pleasure district. It’ll give rise to strange rumours,’ and end it there.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Normally people don&amp;#8217;t send letters to a brothel.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Wouldn’t it be fine if you prepare a different addressee?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Wouldn’t that give Chue-san more work?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was enough that Xiaolan was happy. Getting her involved with Maomao would probably get her monitored. Her letters would be inspected and her replies to Maomao would become bland. For Xiaolan to live in peace, the correct answer was for Maomao to not get into contact with her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao had too many things she couldn’t speak about, like the emperor’s surgery and smallpox.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, at the same time, she felt like she was doing Xiaolan a disservice.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao didn’t want to send a reply because she wanted to know about Xiaolan’s ordinary days. Until the day Xiaolan gives up on writing letters to her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;Has Jinshi-sama heard anything about smallpox?” Even with Jinshi, Maomao had to be careful with her words.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hulang is looking into smallpox currently. You don’t know the infection source of smallpox, is that right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The court physicians have a tacit understanding that their conversations would contain things they couldn’t readily talk about. Jinshi, taking that into account as well, said the words &lt;em&gt;infection source&lt;/em&gt;. “I heard a man called Kokuyou is under suspicion. They say that he had spread smallpox by purposely infecting children with it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So you know this much.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is that guy the culprit?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao shook her head. “Although it is within his capabilities, he has no reason to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Then who could the culprit be?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“May I offer my speculation?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s not speculation, but a deduction.” Jinshi’s face was like their inner palace days when he wanted to order her to solve the mystery.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao crossed her arms. &lt;em&gt;How rude&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. “They are going after children to inoculate them with smallpox. Their actions look the same as Kokuyou’s, but there is a point of difference.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What is this difference?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Kokuyou does it when the children are healthy so the disease doesn’t aggravate. However, the culprit attacks unknown children. Also, being a random attacker, they would not be able to watch its development.” Maomao spoke like she was sorting out her mind. “&amp;#8230;It feels like a half-baked imitation.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What do you mean by imitation?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Imitating a doctor, perhaps? It feels like a child&amp;#8217;s game of make-believe where they only copy what they see and do not understand what they are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“A game of make-believe, huh? Then you mean, someone is doing the treatment to prevent smallpox, but they failed since they only learnt by imitation… “&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That is what I think, but I do not think there is such a person who knows about that smallpox treatment. Besides, it seems like most of the residents of the village that Kokuyou treated have died… Hm?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What’s wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Come to think of it, I think I was told something like there was one adult survivor from that village.” Maomao slapped her brow. She had a feeling Yo told her this, but the memory was vague. “You might know if you ask the court lady by the name of Yo.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao had a feeling Yo said something. She crunched on more pickles. It was perfectly salted, a flavour that made her want to eat it all.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“However, what kind of person is this Kokuyou you talked about earlier?” Jinshi asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jinshi has never met him, huh?&lt;/em&gt; Maomao thought. She would meet all sorts of people day in and day out, so she nearly forgot who knew who. “He’s a man with half of his face covered in smallpox scars. He’s overly cheerful, but his medical knowledge is solid. Also, he’s quite stingy.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Medical knowledge, huh? It looks to me he’s not a court physician.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Correct. He’s a stray doctor. He’s moved around a lot, perhaps due to his misfortunate nature. Come to think of it, he’s asked a lot about horses and cows lately.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Horses and cows? Is this related to the medical treatment?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I think it might be.” Maomao was also curious. “I am also curious, so when Kokuyou proposes something, may I come along as well?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’ll let them know.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Thank you very much.” Maomao bowed her head.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao and Jinshi had a bad habit of turning their conversations into work.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, it couldn’t be helped since they barely have any interests and hobbies in common.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Only that Jinshi enjoyed food from food stalls. It seems his tastes turn towards commoner fare.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao reached for the noodles. This too, was delicious, rich in flavour. “Come to think of it, Chue-san told me there is a good knife-cut noodles stand.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Knife-cut noodles, stand.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was something that Jinshi could never have. The imperial brother had no way of eating leisurely at a food stand in town. He would have to borrow clothes off a manservant and erase his body scent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, for a jaunt around town like they did before, the scar on his right cheek was too conspicuous, and concealing it as a burn scar would also stand out too much.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Although everyone in the inner palace knew the eunuch Jinshi’s face, no one knew him in town back then.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Now that he was known in the capital as the imperial brother, there was no way he could casually dress up for a stroll around town.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Shall I ask if I can get takeaway?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The noodles will get soggy and cold. Most importantly, it tastes better when you slurp the hot noodles when you’re out in the cold.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You know very well how to eat it.” Maomao glanced at Suiren. There was no doubt this capable nanny practiced hard in knife-cutting noodles despite her old age. “Please summon for me when Suiren-sama cooks knife-cut noodles.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Got it, or rather, I’ll summon you over for other things too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As Maomao ate the last of the pickles, she thought, &lt;em&gt;I have to write a report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On that, “&lt;em&gt;The imperial brother is in good health&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-20-a-new-casualty/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-19-health-check/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5269-697a7f131faee' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20260128#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5269&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5269-697a7f131faee' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5269-697a7f131faee' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-19-health-check/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;14.10 The Safflower&amp;nbsp;(2)&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-09-the-safflower-1/"&gt;Previous Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao and the others decided to leave Hao’s residence for now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Unlike the journey to, the carriage was cramped. The reason was Mamei and Chue’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;They could probably squeeze in one more person, but Basen wasn’t useful, so they left him out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As it was already late at night, they decided to share information on their way back.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Now then, how about you give us a recount on what you’ve noticed?” Jinshi, arms crossed, asked Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It will be speculation like always,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Give us speculation like always.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao thought about how she should broach it, then decided to speak frankly as she had nothing to hide. “The concubine was the one who made the poison, and the daughter was the one who was served the poison.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Maomao-san, you spoke so directly. How unusuaaal.” Chue was rocking herself in time with the carriage.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The mother to the daughter, is that right?” Mamei confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Not every mother has maternal feelings, you knooow.” Chue said what Maomao wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Are you certain that she served the poison?” Jinshi asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I cannot declare it outright, but in all possibility, I believe it to be the case.” Maomao presented her basis, “The tea I had just now contained several medicinal herbs. It had a sleep-inducing effect, and didn’t taste bad either&amp;#8230;but it’s likely to be the very tea brewed for the poison in question.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;If Basen were here, he would be squawking. Unfortunately he wasn’t. Jinshi, used to it, was composed with his arms crossed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Seeing as you’re not all that excited, it doesn’t seem like you have ingested poison,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Just as the Moon Prince said. The concubine brewed up a fresh batch instead of the used up tea for heeer,” Chue said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“And even if it were ingested, it would not bring out abnormalities to your body as long as you do not take it everyday,” Maomao added. It was ultimately a slow-acting poison. “And the daughter Zhizi-san’s condition has the same symptoms as taking the poison too.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao looked at Jinshi and Mamei. They looked bewildered. Chue had been with Maomao in that room, so it seems like she was deep into the role of filling in the lacking sections of Maomao’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Maomao remembered the name of a stranger after hearing it once…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s what you’re focused on?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even Maomao has remembered names she heard once. Like Wanwan-senpai.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why would the mother poison her daughter? Just the reasoning that she didn’t give out the used up tea is too weak.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was just as Mamei said. Maomao thought so too.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“As far as I could tell, she didn’t seem like a mother who thought of her daughter. As far as I could teeell.” Chue had some misgivings about the mother.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The fresh tea she brewed for me was a little bitter. Also, it had catnip,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Catnip?” Jinshi asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes. There is cat in its name. Its use is close to silver vine. The herb is used as herbal medicine, but just like silver vine, it’s liked by cats.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Speaking of cats…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Back when she was at the inner palace, there was a detestable calico cat by the name of Maomao that had always gone after the silver vine in the medical office.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If people touch catnip often, the smell might get on them.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Which was why the cat found the poison jar.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“But Zhizi-san’s mother didn’t have a reason to harm her daughter. It’ll make more sense if it were the legal wife instead.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to advance information, the mother and daughter were neglected.&amp;nbsp; Let alone entering the inner palace, the daughter was forced into a detached building without coming out in public.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“To my eyes, the mother and daughter did not look close.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahhh, does Maomao-san think so tooo?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes. That person was less a &lt;em&gt;mother &lt;/em&gt;and more a &lt;em&gt;woman &lt;/em&gt;to me,” Maomao said bluntly. That was the reason she identified the concubine to be a former courtesan.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The reason Chue had misgivings.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;First class courtesans operate by luring in customers. Everything they do is calculated, from the angle they tilt their head to make them look pretty to customers, the flow of their hair, to the movement of their fingers.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The concubine had moved to make herself look the most pitiful to Maomao and the others, the guests. Movements that were very much like the skilled courtesans at the Verdigris Mansion who made themselves look delicate.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“So you mean she was arousing sympathy?” Jinshi asked back, looking like he couldn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes. The concubine and her daughter hadn’t been treated as roughly as our prior information told us. If anything, I think they were treated really well.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The concubine’s attire was the next-most splendid after the lady’s. If she had been neglected, she wouldn’t be allowed to show her face at the imperial brother’s greeting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Same with the daughter. If she had an unknown disease that even doctors have given up on, it would be natural to have her live separately from the main house. I would do the same as it would be scary if it turned out to be infectious. Even the tea she was given had various kinds of herbal medicines. It could not have been cheap.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Above all, the poison in the jar was made from high-grade tea leaves.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“But the bad rumours…” Jinshi said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Honestly, it’s Hao-sama’s wife who did not look well. Suppose there is a concubine who is many years younger and more beautiful around, what would you think? And suppose that concubine, who is a kind mother who thinks of a daughter, is going around looking sorrowful, what would happen?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;People like to create convenient stories. Apart from the servants who were always in the residence, the guests would probably make up their own stories.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It is fine if all of it was just to make herself look delicate, but it is not acceptable to use her daughter as a prop.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“By prop, you don’t mean that she continued to poison her daughter to beget sympathy from other?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I believe that is the most valid reason for the poisoning.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No way.” Jinshi couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;The senior courtesans are jealous of me. Look at the harm I suffered&lt;/em&gt;—there are courtesans who would show their purposely roughly cut hair to customers. Although, it was all done by themselves. This is an extension of that act. She used her daughter to her own advantage and wept to her husband. And her husband would end up feeling compassion for the pitiful woman.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“But the advantage to weakening her daughter by poisoning is too small. Hao-dono has no other daughters. Wouldn’t it be wiser to have her enter the inner palace to become a consort?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Jinshi-sama, can you easily have a concubine’s… a former courtesan’s daughter become a high-ranking consort?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“…” Jinshi couldn’t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Since they controlled the inner palace, the selection of a high-ranking consort was made up of a number of factors.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“With all due respect, didn’t you get a lot of opposition when you promoted Empress Gyokuyou to high-ranking consort?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Empress Gyokuyou’s mother was one of the many wives of Gyoku&amp;#8217;en who governed the lands of the west. She was also mixed with western blood, so even now, there were a lot of voices questioning her suitability to be empress.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I do not know Hao-sama well, but wouldn&amp;#8217;t he pretend there was no courtesan mother to raise the chance of his daughter becoming a high-ranking consort?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The daughter was treated as the child of the legal wife instead of the concubine, which was why she was treated as if she didn’t exist. It was better to erase the existence of the courtesan who was in the background. It was better to have the daughter learn the skills of luring in men from her mother, and should she prove useful, have her become the adopted daughter of the legal wife. She could be registered as the legal wife’s daughter in the family register from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Once the daughter entered the inner palace, the courtesan would have served her purpose.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But what if the daughter couldn’t enter the inner palace due to poor health?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao had no idea about the personality of the man called Hao. However, even supposing he wasn’t a person with deep feelings, he shouldn’t be callous enough to give up on his own daughter. Although not to the level of having her come out in public on a brilliant stage, he wouldn’t abandon her to starve to death.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Let’s say the concubine was looking for a way to not get abandoned by her husband. If she aroused sympathy from those around her, acted like a devoted mother, and occasionally get compared with the legal wife who is neither young nor beautiful, wouldn’t she regain a degree of self-respect?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Neither Jinshi nor Mamei look like they could believe it. Only Chue was grinning ominously.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did she think it was the only way for her to live?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nonetheless, Maomao herself found it really selfish.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not a strong poison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But definitely one that will destroy the body.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Then, it will be fine if we collect the evidence to confirm that fact tomorrow, riiight?” Chue, who seemed to be really good at gathering evidence, said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yes. There is also one place I want investigated,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Where would that beee?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I want you to investigate the cowshed.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The cowshed?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Not only Chue, both Jinshi and Mamei also tilted their heads.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T/N: Catnip in Japanese is 荊芥.

      <description>&lt;main class="wp-block-group is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow"&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-post-title"&gt;SS: Sazen&amp;#8217;s Secret&lt;/h1&gt;   &lt;div style="height:1px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt; &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The sound of something falling on snow. Was it a dead body?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man had stolen a horse from the stables and was fastening his loot to it. He had taken part in the Shi clan&amp;#8217;s insurrection. Of course, it wasn’t out of some lofty ambition. The man was a peasant–he only worked as a guard at the fortress to earn money for food.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He was going to mount the horse and escape as soon as he could. What was he thinking, going to check to see what had fallen?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;My lady?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The girl was buried in the soft snow. Unconscious. There was a hole in the chest area of her dress. The unending white snow piled over her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Her name was Loulan. The daughter of the patriarch of the Shi clan, the leader of this insurrection. She had entered the inner palace to be the emperor’s concubine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Was she dead? No, puffs of her breath coloured the air white.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man swallowed. The girl who had been summoned away by the person above the heavens was so dazzlingly beautiful to a peasant. Such a person was breathing weakly before his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;Ngh.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A pained sound slipped out. She seemed to be really weak.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Find her!&lt;em&gt; Find her&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He heard voices. It was the lot who came to suppress the insurrection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man panicked. If he didn’t hightail it out of here in time, he may well be decapitated. And yet, the fallen girl weighed on his mind. She would be discovered if he left her be. Even if she weren’t found, she would be buried in snow and freeze to death.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man clutched his head, groaned and then sighed. He hoisted the girl out of the snow and over his shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Sorry. It’s a little heavy, so bear with it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man offloaded one of the items he stole. There was another thing he had, but he couldn’t get rid of those. He got on the horse with the girl in front of him and tugged the reins.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man regretted picking up the unexpected thing he found. In an empty hut, he opened her dress. He couldn’t leave her in wet clothes.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The hut was for hunters before they entered the forest. Thanks to that, there was a pelt, which he could use to cover and warm her up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The girl’s, Loulan’s, chest was bruised blue-black. The hole in her dress was from a firearm. Be it luck, a silver hairstick had caught it.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;With hesitation, the man extended his hand to Loulan’s chest. While somehow keeping calm from the soft sensation, he checked the condition of her bones. Her ribs weren’t broken. However, she had a fever and looked like she was in pain. She had fallen in the snow. Since her physical energy had dropped, it wouldn’t be out of the ordinary for her to catch a cold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He wouldn’t be able to run far with a sick person in tow. He would be quickly found if he brought Loulan with him. Loulan was certainly the daughter of his former employer, but he didn’t have that much of a sense of duty to go that far. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Rather, he thought that having brought her to a hut where she wouldn’t be discovered was good enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was snowing outside. The snow probably won’t be stopping any time soon, but as he was used to long winters, he would have no trouble escaping in this environment by himself.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;Can you, do me a favour?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man heard a hoarse voice. He turned around. Loulan, wrapped in the pelt, was awake.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Th-these books…”&amp;nbsp; In Loulan’s hand was an item the man had looted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The cloth bag was filled with thick books. When did she see them?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Bring them… to the capital.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;What are you saying?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was troubling that she was telling him to take them to the capital. The man was currently on the run because of the army that came from the very capital. Once it was known that he participated in the insurrection, he would be arrested.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I beg, of you…” She got up and bowed her head deeply. The woman who had slept with the emperor before was doing that.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The man had a sex drive that was like anyone else. A beautiful woman was bowing her head before him like this. There was no one to stop him, and the woman wouldn’t be able to defy him either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He could do whatever he wanted.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;… were the vulgar thoughts that crossed his mind. Just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For the sake of this country…” Her voice was feeble. And yet, her eyes were bright with a burning fervour.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For the sake of this country…&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;What an odd thing to say. Wasn’t she the daughter of the ringleader who tried to bring down the country?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the man was overpowered by the sparkle in her eyes. Overpowered by a woman who was much weaker than he, who was known as the ephemeral palace*.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-center wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;*probably a pun from Loulan&amp;#8217;s name. Lou &amp;gt; Palace (Roukaku), but ephemeral.&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I, I got it.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;At the same time that naturally came out of his mouth, Loulan collapsed in relief.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He treated her with what he learnt by imitation. In the end, he couldn’t abandon her and waited until Loulan got better. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He entered the forest and looked for medicinal herbs. Previously, he had been at a place where he had gathered medicinal herbs as an errand boy. He somehow kept his eyes on the goal, dug up the snow and found it. He had the doctor who had him work as the errand boy to teach him how to brew medicine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;He made sure to light a fire at night. To keep warm, the two of them would sleep under the same pelt. It wasn’t that he didn’t get strange urges. But if he laid his hands on her, he had a feeling he would be the one eaten rather than the one eating.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It wouldn’t be odd to describe her as a beauty who could bring a nation to ruin. Not her appearance, there was a quality to her that ordinary people didn&amp;#8217;t have.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Am I not attractive? I’m not flat either.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;As her health improved, she would make such jokes. Thanks to that, the man also spoke casually.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;After a short time, Loulan recovered greatly as well. Although the snow had yet to show signs of stopping, they decided to leave the hut.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;When they arrived at a village to the south that was quite some distance from the fortress, Loulan suggested they part ways.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I might end up selling the books, you know,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“That can’t be helped since I can’t go to the capital. But it’s better than having the books burn with the fortress,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What will you do?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There was nowhere for her to go. The world wasn’t so nice for a woman to escape alone.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I’m thinking of running further south.” Loulan grinned. “See ya. All the best.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She turned her back on him without any reluctance to part.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ah, that’s right. It would be nice if you could be a herbalist. It might be your calling.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“No way.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The laughing girl disappeared beyond the snow. He might never see her again.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, Loulan’s words resonated with him. He felt her words somehow became the source of encouragement for him to keep on living.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That was exactly why he won&amp;#8217;t tell anyone, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/ss-sazens-secret/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5479-697a7f1358f22' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20260128#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5479&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5479-697a7f1358f22' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5479-697a7f1358f22' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/ss-sazens-secret/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>

It was a poison common in the imperial court.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“When you fill a bamboo tube with strong tea and bury it in soil for a month, it becomes a poison. It works better with dried and high-grade teas. Although they didn’t use a bamboo tube this time, it should be made the same way. However, I would like to properly check if using a bamboo tube or a jar changes the poison. The book didn’t have a recipe that uses a jar,” Maomao said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You don’t have to check it. Rather, such a book exist?” Jinshi said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If you leave tea for a month, wouldn’t it just go off and give you an upset stomach?” Basen said. He was forced to sit on his knees to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It became a legit poison.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why are you speaking in past tense?” Jinshi sidled up to Maomao.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Hahaha.” Maomao tried to evade it with laughter, but it didn&amp;#8217;t stop Jinshi&amp;#8217;s glaring. Note that when she made it in the past, the madam got mad at her for using the Verdigris Mansion’s high-grade tea leaves and she got frantically detoxed by Luomen when she gradually weakened from testing it out.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“For the time being, it is important we resolve this incident.” Maomao checked the broken jar and the contents, evading the topic. “It doesn’t seem to have completely matured yet. They could have stuck on the curse talismans because they took poison-making to be like sorcery, or they wanted to make it look like they were casting a curse instead of making poison.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mmmn,” Jinshi groaned.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is there anything odd about it?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“How is this poison used? What effect does it have?” Jinshi asked to make sure.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You treat the target with a few drops a day. In doing so, the target’s stomach will gradually weaken, and they will die in a few months&amp;#8217; time.” Maomao also suffered from nausea and stomach pains. If it were a weakened person, they could waste away and die within two months.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi looked at Mamei for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The estate where the curse, no, poison jar was found has a sickly girl. She has a weak stomach and a small appetite,” Mamei said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Her symptoms match,” Jinshi said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Mmmn,” Maomao groaned. “There is a contradiction if it was used as a poison.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Where?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If the poison was already used, wouldn’t it mean that she has been taking it for long enough that it wouldn’t be odd for her to be already dead? Assuming that the poison was made before what was at hand ran out, how much has she been forced to consume until now?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao picked up a shard of the broken jar. “Two drops a day in a jar this big, how many days’ worth would that make?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The jar was big enough to rest on two open palms. Considering how a few drops were used in a day, you could say it contained quite a substantial amount.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It could easily be half a year’s worth.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Then, I do not believe the girl’s weak constitution is from the poison. Based on my own experience with that poison, I reckon it is potent enough to kill someone in poor health within two months…”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi was glowering at her as if to say, “&lt;em&gt;So you really did try it out, huh&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Ahem, anyway. Do I have the opportunity to investigate whether she is still consuming this poison or not?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I would very much like to give you that opportunity, but—”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Is there an issue?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You realised it just now, right? The problem lies with whose residence it is.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao nodded in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She had said it was the empress dowager’s family. Maomao had no idea of the kind of family they were, but at the very least, they had to be a prominent family since they had presented the young empress dowager to the late emperor. She had no idea about the head of the family, but judging by Jinshi’s reaction, it was better to not get involved with them.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Didn’t you send me to Crystal Palace many times back when we were at the inner palace?” Maomao asked.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“&amp;#8230;At Crystal Palace, although the attendants were a different matter, Consort Lihua’s character is excellent, right?” In other words, Jinshi answered that the head of the empress dowager’s family wasn’t excellent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Come to think of it, there is a consort that entered the inner palace from the empress dowager’s family, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yeah. That is also an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Could it be that they came to you for advice on the curse at the start because they believed that a clan was cursed through a consort?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who entered the inner palace again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;She had a feeling it was the empress dowager’s grandchild, no, her sibling’s grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“The family head’s grandniece–she would be the grandniece of the empress dowager as well–entered the inner palace. It is rumoured that she is currently pregnant,” Mamei supplied.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It was a family that wanted to reinstate Jinshi as the crown prince at any cost. No doubt they were unsettled by this matter now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s a bothersome matter, be it a curse or poison.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Why did they bring you a bothersome matter?” Maomao found herself saying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Basen was about to yell out, but Mamei slapped his head and he fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“If it were you, Jinshi-sama, inner palace days aside, shouldn’t it be fine to deal with a heavy hand now?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“It’s also a request from the empress dowager.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“From the empress dowager?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;For the empress dowager, regardless of the kind of family they were, they were her family for sure.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“She came to me to discuss whether I could break the curse of that sickly girl. The jar was found near that girl’s room. The girl is the youngest daughter of the current family head. Under normal circumstances, she would have been the one to enter the inner palace instead of the grandniece. Due to her illness, she was deemed unsuitable to be a consort, and not only that, difficult to be married to any other family, so the people around her treated her as if she didn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Since she’s at a suitable age, that would mean that they are quite far apart in age, right?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Yeah. She’s the child of a concubine. The legal wife discovered the jar and tried to drive out the concubine and her daughter. The family head didn’t try to defend them either.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, the empress dowager was aware of her niece’s existence, and of her obscure position as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“She asked me to save that girl,” Jinshi said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“Then, be it a curse or a poison, it’s a bothersome matter, huh?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Does the empress dowager want proof of the girl’s innocence, or does she want to protect the girl after she has been driven out from the family?&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Jinshi cannot confine a young girl. Then, it would be best for him to provide proof of the girl’s innocence, but curse aside, it would be difficult if it turned out to be poison.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;A typical way to curse someone is to place a charm near them. If it was a curse, they could use the curse to explain the girl’s weak constitution as well.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;However, if it was poison instead of a curse, then the story would change.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;It would completely change into her being the aggressor who had attempted to create poison from ingredients in her disposal to hurt the family that neglected her.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“What does Jinshi-sama want to do?”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“You ask me. The empress dowager is a benevolent person. She would want to rescue that girl at any cost, not caring about the truth of the jar.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asking for the impossible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Maomao crossed her arms and groaned. “We will not know until we see how it actually is.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;“I suppose.” Jinshi wasn’t keen either.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Both Mamei and Basen looked unhappy. Only Chue was having fun like always.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="has-text-align-right wp-block-paragraph"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-09-the-safflower-1/"&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="jp-post-flair" class="sharedaddy sd-like-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled"&gt;&lt;div class="robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-official sd-sharing"&gt;&lt;h3 class="sd-title"&gt;Share this:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sd-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li class="share-facebook"&gt;&lt;div class="fb-share-button" data-href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-08-the-curse-jar-2/" data-layout="button_count"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="share-end"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-130534757-5057-697a7f136afc1' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20260128#blog_id=130534757&amp;amp;post_id=5057&amp;amp;origin=shikarito.wordpress.com&amp;amp;obj_id=130534757-5057-697a7f136afc1' data-name='like-post-frame-130534757-5057-697a7f136afc1' data-title='Like or Reblog'&gt;&lt;div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'&gt;&lt;span class='button'&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='loading'&gt;Loading&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class='sd-text-color'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class='sd-link-color' href="https://shikarito.wordpress.com/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/14-08-the-curse-jar-2/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/main&gt;</description>
