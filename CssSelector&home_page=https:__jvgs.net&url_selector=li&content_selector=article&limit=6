      <description>&lt;article id="post-9249" class="post-9249 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;VIP, FNF, and Game Systems&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, I went to the hotel to design Room 8. I could choose a luxurious room or an antique room, and I chose the former. I used mostly elegant furniture, and some marble items as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room8-sm.jpg" alt="My luxurious hotel room, Room 8." class="wp-image-9256" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I finally upgraded to the Switch 2 version of the game, and I bought the megaphone at Nook&amp;#8217;s Cranny. However, it didn&amp;#8217;t seem to work as intended half the time. Sometimes the wrong villager would respond. I know the New Leaf megaphone wasn&amp;#8217;t perfect either, but this one seems to be even worse (from what little I&amp;#8217;ve used it). &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/megaphone-sm.jpg" alt="Louie, off-screen: My ear muscles feel the burn!" class="wp-image-9262" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I also used a Zelda amiibo to unlock the Zelda items, so I&amp;#8217;ve been continuing to order those and Splatoon items in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On Friday, I had two more repeat tourists, Miranda and Tangy. And they &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;remember me, and they remembered visiting Forest. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tangy-back-sm.jpg" alt="Tangy: That's right! Tangy's back to shake things up on Forest!" class="wp-image-9257" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So the situation with Chester before seems to have been a very specific situation. Because I only chatted with him in the store the first time, he didn&amp;#8217;t properly introduce himself and his name plate still said &amp;#8220;Tourist.&amp;#8221; When that happens, they apparently won&amp;#8217;t remember you. But otherwise, they will.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At the hotel, Leilani told me about a new type of guest room: the VIP room!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/leilani-enjoyed-sm.jpg" alt="Leilani: Ye know, Jeff, ye sure looked like ye enjoyed decoratin'." class="wp-image-9258" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;False.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;VIP rooms are only for guests I specifically invite, but the room only stays that way for one day! Seems like such a waste! But still, I wanted to do it at least once. Leilani asked me to choose one of the day&amp;#8217;s tourists, so I gave it to Tangy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tangy-get-out-sm.jpg" alt="Tangy: A VIP room? For me?! GET. OUT!" class="wp-image-9259" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I could choose my own theme, and I chose a stellar room. I used a crescent-moon chair, Luna&amp;#8217;s bed, and many of Celeste&amp;#8217;s astrological items in here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vip-room-stellar-sm.jpg" alt="A steller themed room for the VIP room at the hotel." class="wp-image-9260" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tangy loved the room, and Leilani said that I can now use an amiibo scanner to invite guests. But considering you need to decorate the room from scratch every time, I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll be using this feature very often.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At 10 p.m., I went to the airport to open my gate for Friday Night Forest. It was my first FNF in &lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/2024/07/01/first-fnf-of-2024/"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt;! Now that I&amp;#8217;m on Switch 2, Orville gives me an option: I can choose a regular (8-player) session, or a Switch 2-only 12-player session.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/orville-12p-sm.jpg" alt="Orville: Do you want to play online in a 12-player session this time?" class="wp-image-9261" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t want to exclude anyone who was playing on a regular Switch, so I just chose the regular session. Sam and Tsu were the first to arrive. Tsu is actually the Sammy that has commented on this blog before. So with a Sam and a Sammy, I joked that the three of us made a Jeff &lt;em&gt;Sam&lt;/em&gt;-wich. 🥪&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After messing around with ocean sunfish and handheld items, we went over to the hotel. But I was shocked and disappointed to see that we can&amp;#8217;t visit hotel guest rooms during multiplayer! That seemed like such a fun, obvious thing we should be able to do! Oof.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-guest-rooms-sm.jpg" alt="I have company right now, so I can visit guest rooms later." class="wp-image-9263" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After walking around town a bit, we played a few games of sumo. I didn&amp;#8217;t win a single round. 😆 But Tsu won two games, and Sam won one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="649" height="336" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sumo-12326.jpg" alt="Tsu wins a round of sumo against Jeff and Sam." class="wp-image-9250" sizes="auto, (max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly before 11 p.m., Michael came over to visit as well. We talked Animal Crossing on GameCube, and how ACNH 3.0 must take forever to load 12 players. 😆 We then posed for a group photo near the shore. You can also see Gullivarrr back there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/group-fnf-12326-sm.jpg" alt="Tsu, Sam, Jeff, and Michael during Friday Night Forest." class="wp-image-9265" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We did some crab walking on the beach, and it was pretty funny. 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="649" height="373" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/crab-walk.jpg" alt="The four of us crab walking on the beach." class="wp-image-9252" sizes="auto, (max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We then competed in a 10-minute diving contest; Mike and I finished tied for the lead with 22 catches apiece. I was a fraction of a second from catching #23, though. This last one didn&amp;#8217;t count. 😛 &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/diving-12326-sm.jpg" alt="Time's up!" class="wp-image-9264" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that was a very close game! Good game, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="619" height="376" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/3venus.jpg" alt="Three of us holding up Venus flower baskets after diving." class="wp-image-9253" sizes="auto, (max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We eventually went back to my house for a bit until I ended the session around midnight. Thanks for coming, Sam, Tsu, and Micheal!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Grams told me her selection of souvenirs has now expanded to the maximum! It included a few Nintendo items like the Ultra Hand and Love Tester, but most importantly, it included seven game systems!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="690" height="388" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/systems.jpg" alt="Items available from Grams: Nintendo Switch 2, Famicom, NES, Famicom Disk System, Game Boy, Super Famicom, Super NES (NTSC version), Super NES (PAL version)." class="wp-image-9255" sizes="auto, (max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I ordered five of the systems (starting from the bottom of the list and going up).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;When I checked the hotel guests, I was not happy to see Beardo has made his return! At least it&amp;#8217;s just for a day. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beardo-return-sm.jpg" alt="Beardo: Whoa. You're Jeff, right? THE Jeff!" class="wp-image-9266" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I received my first five systems. Of course, they give you a warning/reminder that you can only play the games with a Nintendo Switch Online membership. We knew that already, of course, but it still annoys me a bit. The original Animal Crossing had NES games not only as a free bonus, but as a major selling point for Animal Crossing in the first place! Kind of a shame to see the games require a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But I tried out all five. The Famicom Disk System plays Ice Hockey, and the computer scored three goals on me before I could figure out how to control my player. 😆 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;The Game Boy played Dr. Mario, which is always fun&amp;#8230;even though playing a game based on three colors of pills isn&amp;#8217;t an ideal game to play in black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/drmario.jpg" alt="Playing Dr. Mario in Animal Crossing: New Horizons." class="wp-image-9268" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Super Famicom plays Panel de Pon, which is basically Tetris Attack. Great puzzle game! Of course, the menus are in Japanese, though. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/panel.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Panel de Pon for Super Famicom, as played in Animal Crossing: New Horizons." class="wp-image-9269" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And finally, both versions of the Super NES play F-Zero. That&amp;#8217;s a really good game too, but I wish one of them played something different, just for more variety. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Keaton became the latest former villager to return as a hotel tourist today, and it was good to see him in Forest again!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/keaton-returns-sm.jpg" alt="Keaton: You know I spent a little time here as a young eagle, right? That's why I came back for a vaycay!" class="wp-image-9267" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are a few other quick notes about the past few days:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;I delivered a gift (a paper tiger) from June to Bob. He thanked me by giving me a safe.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I helped out Gullivarrr on Friday, and he sent me a pirate dress yesterday.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Last night, K.K. performed &amp;#8220;K.K. Lovers&amp;#8221; for me and Ankha. He must have the wrong idea about us! 😛&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I gave medicine to a sick Agent S today, and she gave me a fitness tank in return.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I returned a lost item to Bob, and he rewarded me with a pinball machine. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;p&gt;See you all next time!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/2026/01/25/vip-fnf-game-systems/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2026-01-25T23:23:23-05:00"&gt;January 25, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2026-01-25T23:30:12-05:00"&gt;January 25, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

I uploaded the video today:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="ACCF - Snowy Day Gameplay Session 30 mins (Animal Crossing: City Folk)" width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgConO7FZvk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Today, I received a snowman wardrobe in the mail from the snowman I built yesterday. And speaking of that snowman, he was a little smaller (and perhaps cuter) today&amp;#8230;but he was still just as happy with himself.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8478-sm.jpg" alt="Snowman: I'll be looking fine when I represent Forest in the 2026 Mr. Snowman Snowslam!" class="wp-image-13829" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was snowing again tonight, and Camofrog was so freezing that I was afraid he was about to croak. 🐸&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="499" height="280" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/accf-camo-cold.jpg" alt="Camofrog: B-b-bah!

And now that the sun's down, it's even w-w-worse, ten-hut!" class="wp-image-13832" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I snuck up on the bulletin board bird and moved the camera so he practically flew right into it. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="499" height="280" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/accf-bird-sm2026.jpg" alt="The bulletin board bird flies toward the camera in Animal Crossing: City Folk." class="wp-image-13833" sizes="auto, (max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A bit later, I went up to the Roost and asked K.K. Slider for a random song. He performed &amp;#8220;Cafe K.K.&amp;#8221; for me.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8479-sm.jpg" alt="K.K.: All right, get ready to dig the riffs on this ditty: Cafe K.K.." class="wp-image-13830" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a pretty good song, but it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;the same song&lt;/em&gt; he just sang for me last week! Two weeks in a row is a bit much!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After completely circling around town, I finally noticed a new house right next door to mine. It was in the same spot where Mint just recently lived. Inside, I found Willow the yellow sheep.

The recipients were grateful&amp;#8230;well, &lt;em&gt;most &lt;/em&gt;of them were grateful.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/phyllis-pathetic.jpg" alt="Phyllis: Hm... So you're working for Saharah now, huh? (How pathetic!)" class="wp-image-8601" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Saharah then rewarded me with a desert vista.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Whitney was talking about her preferences in clothing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/whitney-comfort.jpg" alt="Whitney: If you're talking about comfort, nothing beats cashmere, on a pig!" class="wp-image-8602" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Robin has been asking me for blue furniture again, so I gave her a blue wardrobe that I bought at Nookington&amp;#8217;s. She was happy with it, and she rewarded me with a croton. She put the wardrobe on display in her house right away, and apparently, she even made a mess of it already! 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/robin-chaos.jpg" alt="Me, looking in Robin's new blue wardrobe: Ugh!

It's a whirlwind romance!" class="wp-image-8604" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Back outside, Frobert was going on and on about how magnificent he looks when he pumps iron late at night. 🙄&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/frobert-calves.jpg" alt="Frobert: Check out the way the moonlight shines off my chiseled calves!" class="wp-image-8605" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tonight, Filbert was talking about paparazzi, and he was wondering how to pronounce the word. But then he surprised me by warning me about Whitney! He said she always seems to be chasing people down!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/filbert-whitney.jpg" alt="Filbert: Well, watch out!

Frobert then rewarded me with some cabana flooring.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At the Roost, I asked K.K. Slider for a random song. He performed one of my favorites, &amp;#8220;Two Days Ago.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/kk-12426.jpg" alt="K.K.: All right, get ready to dig the riffs on this ditty: Two Days Ago!" class="wp-image-8607" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0ff365ea4b4ae589e18c26b092fe26946a6e14116b63065f41029c8c6138c7c8?s=98&amp;d=mm&amp;r=g' class='avatar avatar-49 photo' height='49' width='49'/&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/2026/01/24/robins-chaotic-wardrobe/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2026-01-24T23:56:12-05:00"&gt;January 24, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2026-01-24T23:56:13-05:00"&gt;January 24, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt; &lt;/article&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;article id="post-9233" class="post-9233 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;Repeat Tourist&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;On Monday, I saw a tourist I definitely did not want to see in my town: Jambette!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jambette-tourist-sm.jpg" alt="Tourist: You're from Forest, right? I'm here on a trip. My name's Jambette." class="wp-image-9235" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So of course, I just &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;to pitfall her. It&amp;#8217;s the law here in Forest. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jambette-pitfall-sm.jpg" alt="Jambette after falling into a pitfall. Oops." class="wp-image-9236" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the hotel, I asked about designing Room 5. Leilani asked me to choose a skyscraper room or a diner room, and I chose the former. I mostly used the cool furniture up here, and I hope my tourists will enjoy the view.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room5-sm.jpg" alt="My skyscraper-themed room at the hotel. It's Room 5." class="wp-image-9237" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Leilani paid me the usual 200 tickets for my work, but I also earned 1,000 Nook Miles for designing my 5th room. Unfortunately, I learned that for the final decorating achievement, you have to design &lt;strong&gt;twenty &lt;/strong&gt;rooms! Yikes. I guess that means we&amp;#8217;ll eventually have to re-design rooms to keep earning the miles. Not my idea of fun.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Monday&amp;#8217;s other hotel guests included Hamphrey, Cousteau, and Miranda. I guess the Ugly Convention was in town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="578" height="199" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ugly-convention.jpg" alt="Jambette, Hamphrey, Cousteau, and Miranda staying at the hotel." class="wp-image-9234" sizes="auto, (max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While out diving, I found a scallop. Pascal popped up, as usual, but he gave me something different instead of a pearl: a &lt;em&gt;pair &lt;/em&gt;of pearls! Pearls are worth 10,000 bells each, so he basically gave me 20k for a scallop! Nice!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pascal-pair-pearls-sm.jpg" alt="Pascal: Since you were cool, I slipped you a pair of pearls." class="wp-image-9238" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I designed Room 6 at the hotel. I chose to decorate it as a lodge room instead of a Japanese-retro room. I used mostly log furniture, and I thought it looks really cozy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room6-sm.jpg" alt="My lodge room at the hotel. It's Room 6." class="wp-image-9239" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The hotel guests for the day were Chester, Tangy, Tipper, Cally, and Cephalobot. Tangy even said Forest slays at night! 🥰&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tangy-slays-sm.jpg" alt="Tangy: Forest slays at night." class="wp-image-9240" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chester was a repeat tourist, because he also visited the hotel two days earlier (on the 18th). But interestingly, he didn&amp;#8217;t remember me!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chester-tourist-no-remember-sm.jpg" alt="Tourist: Hey, my name's Chester! Do you live here?" class="wp-image-9241" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So even though former villagers will remember you, repeat tourists apparently won&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8230;even if it&amp;#8217;s only been two days! Wild.*&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I later found Tangy enjoying some coffee at the Roost. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tangy-roost-sm.jpg" alt="Tangy: My stardom matures while I sit in a cafe, alone on vacation, away from my usual day-to-day, reeeeOWR." class="wp-image-9242" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I designed Room 7 at the hotel. I chose a frozen room instead of an exquisite room, so of course I used mostly ice furniture here. Looks like a good place to just chill. It even has a little snowman as a bartender. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room7-sm.jpg" alt="My frozen room with ice furniture at the hotel. It's Room 7." class="wp-image-9243" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Admit it. It&amp;#8217;s an ice room.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s tourists were Cherry, Nana, Mac, Lionel, Maelle, and Elvis. I like those first three, but not the last three. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mac-tourist-sm.jpg" alt="Tourist: Hey, are you from around here? Nice! I'm Mac, traveler and personal trainer at your service." class="wp-image-9244" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I scanned my Inkling squid amiibo, which invited Viche to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/viche-amiibo-sm.jpg" alt="Viche: I plan on overstaying my welcome! Just kidding--please know I'd never really do that, lip-synch..." class="wp-image-9245" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not interested in her, but I just wanted to unlock the Splatoon items in the &amp;#8220;Special Goods&amp;#8221; section of the Nook Shopping app. I&amp;#8217;ve actually forgotten about these, so I haven&amp;#8217;t even ordered any of the Lego items yet either. But I&amp;#8217;ve started the process now; it&amp;#8217;ll just take a while with the 5-items-per-day limit.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, I posted a new video: Pitfall Pandemonium 2026! I used a Slumber Island to summon some previous villagers of mine and let them fall into some pitfalls. Good times. 😆&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Pitfall Pandemonium 2026 (Animal Crossing: New Horizons ACNH Version 3.0)" width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idrMoN9fT5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still planning on opening my gate for Friday Night Forest on Friday at 10 p.m. Eastern (US) time. Anyone on my roster is welcome. Again, just don&amp;#8217;t expect any big new obstacle courses or anything because I haven&amp;#8217;t even started on such a thing yet. But we can hang out in Forest, check out the hotel, meet the villagers, and maybe play some sumo or something. But note that the blog entry probably won&amp;#8217;t be up until the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;*Update: Some commenters on Tumblr said they&amp;#8217;ve had repeat tourists that &lt;em&gt;did &lt;/em&gt;remember them. When I met Chester the first time, he was shopping in Able Sisters&amp;#8230;so I&amp;#8217;m wondering if it doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;count&amp;#8221; if they&amp;#8217;re shopping? Not sure, but I&amp;#8217;ll keep an eye out for repeat tourists in the future!&lt;/p&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/2026/01/21/repeat-tourist/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2026-01-21T19:08:07-05:00"&gt;January 21, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2026-01-21T22:15:54-05:00"&gt;January 21, 2026&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

The list contains not only your current villagers, but also your previous villagers. Remember seeing these villagers in Forest?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/slumber-previous-sm.jpg" alt="A list of my previous villagers." class="wp-image-9220" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After paying Tom Nook 1.5 million bells Wednesday night, my storage was expanded to hold 7,000 items on Thursday. I know I can expand it again to 9,000, but I&amp;#8217;m not in a rush to do that right now.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I encountered my 2nd tourist on Thursday, it was O&amp;#8217;Hare the rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ohare-tourist-sm.jpg" alt="Tourist: Hey, you're from this island, aren't you? Enchante. The name's O'Hare!" class="wp-image-9221" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Leilani told me about the mannequins, and I displayed a frog suit on one of them. The mannequin outfits will be useful for multiplayer sessions, although I don&amp;#8217;t have anything specific themes in mind so far.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/leilani-mannequins-sm.jpg" alt="Leilani: Did ye know that hotel guests can borrow entire outfits from the mannequins here?" class="wp-image-9222" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I designed another hotel room, and I was given an option to design a Japanese room or a modern room. I chose the latter, and I used some iron, tubular, and cool furniture.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room2-sm.jpg" alt="My modern hotel room design." class="wp-image-9223" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I earned another 200 hotel tickets for designing the room, but no tourists showed up to rent it like they did with the first room.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I was informed by Mr_DotoroBear that you can use the &amp;#8220;L&amp;#8221; button jump and slide. I later learned that it&amp;#8217;s actually to help when using the Island Designer app (so you can clearly discern which space you&amp;#8217;re on and move to the next one quickly). But I noticed that if you press L on a bridge, it doesn&amp;#8217;t work&amp;#8230;and your character makes a disappointed face. 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="381" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cant-jump.jpg" alt="Jeff makes his disappointed 'can't jump' face as Kid Cat looks on." class="wp-image-9214" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Friday, I went to design Room 3. For the theme, I could choose a simple room or a ranch room. I chose the latter, and of course I mostly used ranch furniture. I&amp;#8217;m not putting tons of effort into these things. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room3-sm.jpg" alt="My ranch room at the hotel." class="wp-image-9224" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anicotti and Jacob were the tourists for the day. I found Anicotti over by Resident Services, and she said somebody should offer a swim/dive/fish tour. That&amp;#8217;s pretty bold of Nintendo to mention tours when it just reminds me of the island tours from New Leaf that aren&amp;#8217;t in this game. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anicotti-swimdivefish-sm.jpg" alt="Anicotti: Like, you have SEEN the ocean?! You can swim, dive, fish... Somebody should offer a swimdivefish tour." class="wp-image-9225" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I designed Room 4 at the hotel. I chose to make a kiddie room instead of a dreamy room, and I used a lot of these new kiddie items. Unfortunately, this kiddie slide still can&amp;#8217;t be used. Slides need to be usable items! 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hotel-room4-sm.jpg" alt="The kiddie room at the Forest Hotel." class="wp-image-9226" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tipper, Axel, and Coco were the tourists for the day. Interestingly enough, Coco wanted cocoa! What a &lt;em&gt;co&lt;/em&gt;-incidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/coco-cocoa-sm.jpg" alt="Coco: But hot cocoa is tempting too..." class="wp-image-9227" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I spotted Monty the monkey walking around outside my house as I checked my mail. Monty recently moved out of my City Folk town, so it caught me off guard to see him here. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll have to get used to these surprises. 😛 Bubbles, Chester, and Fauna were the other tourists for the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4tourists.jpg" alt="Which room will you visit? Occupied by Fauna." class="wp-image-9219" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t design a hotel room today, but I think it might be a bit overwhelming once I get to the point where there&amp;#8217;s eight tourists in town every day! That seems like overkill, especially considering we can only have ten villagers of our own.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I found Chester in Able Sisters, so you can indeed find tourists in shops as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chester-able-sm.jpg" alt="Tourist: I don't want my eyes to get too strong." class="wp-image-9228" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are a few other quick notes from the past few days:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;On Thursday, Gulliver sent me a tubeteika.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I learned that customization kits can also be used from storage, so there&amp;#8217;s no need to carry them with you.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Friday, I sold 32 bugs to Flick for 144,750 bells.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Last night, K.K. Slider performed &amp;#8220;K.K. Mambo&amp;#8221; for me, June, and Bob.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I built a perfect snowboy yesterday, and he sent me another three-tiered snowperson today.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I recently posted a video showing highlights of my first two days with the Version 3.0 update. So please check it out if you haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="ACNH Version 3.0 - My First Impressions/First 2 Days (Animal Crossing: New Horizons)" width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLVz8upWTC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I may also have another video for tomorrow, so stay tuned for that!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;And FYI, I&amp;#8217;m still planning on having a Friday Night Forest this week (January 23rd).

So long, Mint!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8469-sm.jpg" alt="Dear Jeff, I've decided to move away from Forest.

Of course, I missed out on it, but he informed me that Deena won the horse mackerel-only tourney by catching a 17.2-incher. Congrats, Deena!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8470-sm.jpg" alt="Chip: Deena from here in Forest! Solid fishing! But not so much for you. Nyuuk nyuk!" class="wp-image-13818" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I went over to the Roost to check out the Saturday night show, and K.K. performed &amp;#8220;Cafe K.K.&amp;#8221; for me.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8471-sm.jpg" alt="K.K.: All right, get ready to dig the riffs on this ditty: Cafe K.K.." class="wp-image-13819" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the show, Camofrog asked me to make a delivery to Scoot for him. He didn&amp;#8217;t want to do it himself because he was afraid he&amp;#8217;d be spotted&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8472-sm.jpg" alt="Camofrog: See, if I get spotted handing over a present, things could get sticky..." class="wp-image-13820" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he&amp;#8217;s camouflaged! How would anyone spot him? &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On the way to Scoot&amp;#8217;s house, I stopped to roll up a big snowman near the top of the waterfall. Fortunately, he was pleased with his appearance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8473-sm.jpg" alt="Snowman: But I never dreamed that I'd wind up this gorgeous!

Wow! It looks like this is starting a feud between them! Or&amp;#8230;a &lt;em&gt;flame &lt;/em&gt;war. The shirt isn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;bad, man. I actually like it myself. 😛&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I returned to Camofrog, and he was shocked that the gift didn&amp;#8217;t go over well. He rewarded me with a boxing mat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/RUU_8476-sm.jpg" alt="Camofrog: GRAH!
