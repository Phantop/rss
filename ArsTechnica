Maybe it’s through an interview posted on the video-sharing platform Rumble. Or maybe it’s the targeted advertisements on Google: “We do medical exemptions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cassandra Clerkin, a mother in upstate New York, first got in touch with Frontline Health Advocates near the start of the 2024–2025 school year, after hearing they had doctors who would write exemptions from school immunization requirements. One of Clerkin’s children, she said, had suffered seizures after receiving a vaccine. The family didn’t want more shots. But New York has some of the country’s strictest school immunization policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Frontline could help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2023/09/18/college-covid-vaccine-boosters-science/"&gt;mandates&lt;/a&gt; have a &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2020/03/16/quarantine-powers-us-covid19/"&gt;long history&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, but they’ve been subject to fresh public attention—and partisan dispute—since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Frontline Health Advocates seemingly emerged from pandemic-era battles with a model that, experts say, appears to be unique: It bills itself as a standalone organization that supplies people across the US with medical exemptions from vaccination requirements—for a fee of $495.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On forms obtained by Undark, Frontline’s listed addresses are a storage facility in Denison, Texas, and a package store in Sedona, Arizona. The group publishes little information online about its leadership or finances, but it has quietly developed a following.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s little question that Frontline exemptions sometimes work, and some parents report positive experiences with the organization. But there are real questions about whether its legal strategy would hold up in court—and whether clients are confused about what, precisely, they are receiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In upstate New York, Clerkin said she spoke with a representative from Frontline by phone about the process. They made it sound, she said, like getting an exemption “would be pretty seamless.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;Soon after, she recalled, she received a call from a doctor named Andrew Zywiec. A week after the family issued a credit card payment of $495 to a chiropractic firm in California, the medical exemption arrived by email. “The duration of the restriction from receiving VACCINATIONS is PERMANENT,” the document stated, citing a range of health concerns, and warning that civil or criminal penalties could result if the school district ignored the request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clerkin submitted the document to the district.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bolded"&gt;very state&lt;/span&gt; in the country has legal language on the books that seems to &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2025/08/04/idaho-vaccine-policy/"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; certain immunizations before children can enroll in school—although in some places exemption policies are so lax that shots are effectively optional. The military also has vaccine requirements, as do some civilian workplaces, including many hospitals and nursing homes. Immigration proceedings, too, often require applicants to receive shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people may register personal objections to vaccination, or they may have medical conditions that could make receiving a shot dangerous. Workarounds exist. Most states, for example, allow parents to apply for religious or personal belief exemptions from school vaccine requirements by stating that they object to vaccination due to deeply held convictions. But those exemptions are sometimes denied, and in four states—California, Connecticut, Maine, and New York—they aren’t an option at all. (The policy in a fifth state, West Virginia, is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/11/us/west-virginia-school-vaccines.html"&gt;currently in flux&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In those states, the only way to attend school without a required shot is to receive a medical waiver. There are real reasons for some people to pursue them: They may be immunocompromised in a way that makes certain vaccines high-risk, or they may have had a bad reaction to a shot in the past. In some cases, families may earnestly believe their child cannot safely receive a vaccine, but have difficulty finding a physician who agrees, or who is willing to attest to that on an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/inside-the-marketplace-for-vaccine-medical-exemptions/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interest in medical exemptions tends to grow when laws tighten. In 2015, after a measles outbreak at Disneyland sickened hundreds of people, California lawmakers ended the state’s personal belief exemption. Almost immediately, the medical exemption rate more than doubled, according to a &lt;a href="file:///Users/michaelschulson/Desktop/Frontline/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304768"&gt;2019 paper&lt;/a&gt; by a team of public health researchers. The law “created a black market for medical exemptions,” one unnamed health officer told the researchers. Parents, the officer added, would go online and “get medical exemptions from physicians who were not their child’s treating physician.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state cracked down, prosecuting some health care providers for allegedly providing improper medical exemptions, and tightening the rules for receiving a waiver. New York, which eliminated religious exemptions in 2019, has taken similar steps; the Department of Health maintains a public list of health care providers who have been banned or suspended from using immunization registries in the state, on a webpage &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/schools/fraud.htm"&gt;titled&lt;/a&gt; “School Vaccination Fraud Awareness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In New York, advocates say, state policies have made it prohibitively difficult for some families to obtain medical exemptions, regardless of the reason. “My understanding is that up until this year, again, a lot of doctors weren’t willing to write these medical exemptions,” said Chad Davenport, an attorney outside Buffalo, New York, who often represents families seeking medical exemptions. (One of his clients recently &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/oceanside-school-district-teenager-banned-hepatitis-b-vaccine/"&gt;won&lt;/a&gt; a key ruling in a federal court case against a Long Island school district that had denied medical exemptions from at least six health care providers.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enter Frontline Health Advocates. The organization, Davenport said, “kind of stepped in and provided families at least an option, or a potential path.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two researchers who have studied vaccination exemptions in the United States said the organization appears to have a unique model: While individual doctors have sometimes gained a reputation for supplying medical exemptions, neither expert had seen a full-fledged national organization offering those services.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;“They’re very blatant,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco who studies vaccine law and policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group’s founder and director is William Lionberger, a chiropractor who has been licensed to practice in California since 1981, and who once maintained a practice north of San Diego. According to public records, he has also served as a police officer in a town near Sedona. (Lionberger declined a request for an on-the-record interview, and the organization did not answer a list of questions from Undark.) Interviewers who have hosted Lionberger on their shows &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/vwk1a5-one-of-americas-frontline-doctors-bill-lionberger-sharing-important-informa.html?e9s=src_v1_ucp_a"&gt;describe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2ssecg-what-will-police-do-if-ordered-to-enforce-pandemic-quarantine.html"&gt;him&lt;/a&gt; as affiliated with America’s Frontline Doctors, a group that opposed Covid-19 vaccines and other public health measures while promoting unproven treatments like &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2020/04/09/hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-clinical-trials-harder/"&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frontline Health Advocates’ webpage was first registered in March 2022, with a name echoing that of America’s Frontline Doctors. By April of that year, the website was &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220429222909/https:/frontlinehealthadvocates.com/"&gt;inviting&lt;/a&gt; visitors to “Get your exemption now.” In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://rumble.com/v2cisdq-the-war-for-america-original-front-line-doctor-sharing-intel-and-strategies.html"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, Lionberger described having a “team of medical experts” who “work with all kinds of situations,” evaluating clients both for “regular vax injuries and regular vax exemptive conditions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: “People now don’t even want their kids to get anywhere near a regular vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group employs a pair of distinctive legal strategies. One of these is to form itself as something called a Private Ministerial Association. Online, some groups that help set up such private associations describe them as offering special First Amendment protections. A membership application document hosted on Frontline’s website describes the group as “a private, unincorporated ministry that operates as much as possible, outside the jurisdiction of government entities, agencies, officers, agents, contractors, and other representatives, as protected by law.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to invoke federal disability law. In the 2023 interview, Lionberger boasted that they drew on “the most powerful thing that you can bring against discrimination”—specifically, federal protections. A promotional video &lt;a href="https://frontlinehealthadvocates.com/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on the Frontline website makes a similar claim, advertising waivers “supported by the protections under US federal laws.” Undark obtained three near-identical exemptions sent to New York families in 2024. In them, Frontline argues that the client’s need for a medical exemption is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, which guarantees certain accommodations for people with disabilities and other medical needs.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;In Frontline documents from 2024, the organization suggests that this federal protection supersedes state vaccination laws—offering a way around exemption policies across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-3" data-page="3" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/11/inside-the-marketplace-for-vaccine-medical-exemptions/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bolded"&gt;n New York, &lt;/span&gt;Clerkin had received a document combining medical language with legal details. The document bore the signatures of doctor Andrew Zywiec and an administrative law specialist and JD, Christine Pazzula, along with the seal of the United States Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everything was quite as it seemed. Frontline has no relationship with the Department of Justice. Pazzula, according to her LinkedIn profile, had received her legal degree from an unaccredited correspondence school in California, and her name does not appear in databases of attorneys admitted to the bar in New York, Texas, or Nevada, where her LinkedIn profile says she is based. (In a brief email to Undark, Pazzula said she no longer works for Frontline.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another parent who received a Frontline exemption in 2024 would later testify under oath that she believed Zywiec to be a physician licensed in the state of New York, but state records show that nobody named Zywiec has ever held a medical license in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multiple online testimonials about Frontline mention Zywiec. A review of public records suggests a turbulent history. Zywiec served in the Army and graduated from medical school in 2019, according to a CV. In 2020, he began a pediatrics residency at The Brooklyn Hospital Center, but the relationship soured: He ultimately sued the hospital, alleging an unsafe work environment, and filed an employment complaint that, among other concerns, said he had been “coerced into taking the so-called Covid-19 vaccine.” In court documents associated with the lawsuit, a hospital official described an employee who was “spotty and difficult.” In 2021, Zywiec’s co-residents had written a letter to their superiors alleging that he had made offensive remarks to colleagues and treated nurses poorly, also writing that he “would delay care to patients because he wanted to participate in procedures unrelated to his patients because they interested him.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Zywiec maintains an &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250424052515/https://www.zywiecandporter.com/about-3"&gt;online medical practice&lt;/a&gt;, where he describes himself as “an international medical doctor and board-certified indigenous medicine provider” and offers a range of services, including a $150, 30-minute, “Medical Excuse/Note” consultation that yields a “legitimate medical excuse tailored to your situation.” On X, where he has amassed a following in the tens of thousands, Zywiec regularly shares content about the dangers of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The promotional video on Frontline’s website describes the exemptions as “signed by state-licensed physicians with full credentials.” Zywiec’s name does not appear in a national database of licensed physicians maintained by the Federation of State Medical Boards. (In a brief email, Zywiec referred interview requests to Frontline. He did not answer a list of questions from Undark, and Frontline did not respond to a question about Zywiec’s license status.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exemption that Zywiec had signed for Clerkin was denied. In a letter, the school district explained that New York law requires exemptions to be signed by a physician licensed in the state. Clerkin said that she was aware Zywiec was not licensed in New York, but Frontline seemed confident in their approach, and she thought it might work. That did not pan out, she said. “I feel like they talk this big thing,” Clerkin said. But, she added, “if you know that you can’t help these children, and you’re just preying on these mothers who will do anything for their children, that is evil.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some Frontline exemptions do get through, at least in New York. “I can certainly tell you that there have been some people, even this year, who have been able to get their Frontline Health waivers accepted,” Davenport told Undark. But, he said, courts have not tested the argument that an exemption invoking federal law will trump the state’s requirement that the exemption comes from a New York-licensed physician. He does not recommend Frontline to clients. “I basically tell them, although Frontline may technically be correct, it’s not a good legal position for you to be in,” Davenport said. “And so I always advise them to try to get a New York state waiver signed by a New York state doctor and then submit that, because that puts you in the best legal position.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;In a video on its website, Frontline warns potential clients that exemptions may be denied, noting that the group “cannot guarantee that an unknown person you are engaging with is going to abide by federal laws.” But Rita Palma, a health freedom activist on Long Island who has worked with many families seeking medical exemptions, told Undark that she thinks parents are still confused about the limitations of the waivers. “What I’m getting from parents is that Frontline Health Advocates say that federal law overrides state law,” she said. Whether or not that’s true in the case of vaccine exemptions remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $495 fee—extra for expedited service—is a steep price for some families. “They’ve made a nice killing in New York,” Palma said. “I hate to put it like that, but they’ve definitely gotten a lot of parents to pay them to get exemptions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bolded"&gt;t’s difficult&lt;/span&gt; to know how many waivers Frontline has sold. In online forums, people describe successes with schools. “I got lifetime medical exemptions for my children,” one parent wrote in a Facebook group in April, noting that she was not affiliated with Frontline. The group is “replete with lawyers to respond to any pushback from schools,” she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One mother in Connecticut told Undark that she had contacted Frontline in 2024, when her son needed a flu shot to stay in daycare. “I was looking around for a way to get an exemption,” she said. (The mother spoke on condition of anonymity, citing a professional need for privacy.) After a phone call with a licensed pediatrician in Texas, she received an exemption. The daycare, she said, accepted it. “It was a pretty smooth experience, overall,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was aware that it was a gamble,” the mother said; Frontline had told her the exemption might not be accepted. “But then they kind of were like, well, you know, technically, if they don’t accept it, it’s illegal because it’s protected by ADA and all that kind of thing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;The group has attracted attention from some public health officials. In Los Angeles County, a public health department website is topped by a large red banner warning that Frontline exemptions don’t work in California. In October 2024, in Connecticut, minutes from a meeting of the state’s School Nurse Advisory Council &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/sde/school-nursing/school-nurse-advisory-council/snac_minutes_2024_october.pdf"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; Frontline as providing what the council believed to be “fraudulent” exemptions to families. A spokesperson for Connecticut Public Health, Brittany Schaefer, told Undark in late September that Frontline is the subject of “an active investigation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Undark asked three legal experts to review a copy of an exemption issued to a family in New York in September 2024 and obtained via court records. “It seems to be a fill-in-the-blank type of form,” said Barbara Hoffman, an expert in disability law at Rutgers Law School. The waiver, Hoffman believes, overstates the penalties generally levied for ADA infractions. School districts, employers, or others who received this form, she speculated, might feel like “it’s not worth the effort to reject this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This looks like an official document,” she added, highlighting the seal of the Department of Justice and references to potential civil penalties. “It’s designed to intimidate somebody who doesn’t really know better, or just doesn’t want to risk any potential litigation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Could invoking the ADA really override state-level vaccine requirements? Reiss, the UC Law San Francisco expert, was skeptical, noting that state law has generally held in similar cases. “My expectation,” she wrote in an email, “is that that won’t hold.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on &lt;a href="https://undark.org"&gt;Undark&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         YouTubers suspect AI is bizarrely removing popular video explainers.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2216630168-1152x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2216630168-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2216630168-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2216630168-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2216630168-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                        &lt;a class="caption-credit-link text-gray-400 no-underline hover:text-gray-500" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/composite-photo-collage-of-thoughtful-man-instead-royalty-free-image/2216630168?phrase=robot%20tv&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"               target="_blank"&gt;                      Deagreez | iStock / Getty Images Plus                        &lt;/a&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="" name="page-1" data-page="1" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/youtube-denies-ai-was-involved-with-odd-removals-of-tech-tutorials/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, tech content creators began to suspect that AI was making it harder to share some of the most highly sought-after tech tutorials on YouTube, but now YouTube is denying that odd removals were due to automation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Creators grew alarmed when educational videos that YouTube had allowed for years were suddenly being bizarrely flagged as “dangerous” or “harmful,” with seemingly no way to trigger human review to overturn removals. AI seemed to be running the show, with creators’ appeals seemingly getting denied faster than a human could possibly review them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Late Friday, a YouTube spokesperson confirmed that videos flagged by Ars have been reinstated, promising that YouTube will take steps to ensure that similar content isn’t removed in the future. But, to creators, it remains unclear why the videos got taken down, as YouTube claimed that both initial enforcement decisions and decisions on appeals were not the result of an automation issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shocked creators were stuck speculating&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rich White, a computer technician who runs an account called CyberCPU Tech, had two videos removed that demonstrated workarounds to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These videos are popular, White told Ars, with people looking to bypass Microsoft account requirements each time a new build is released. For tech content creators like White, “these are bread and butter videos,” dependably yielding “extremely high views,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because there’s such high demand, many tech content creators’ channels are filled with these kinds of videos. White’s account has “countless” examples, he said, and in the past, YouTube even featured his most popular video in the genre on a trending list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To White and others, it’s unclear exactly what has changed on YouTube that triggered removals of this type of content.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YouTube only seemed to be removing recently posted content, White told Ars. However, if the takedowns ever impacted older content, entire channels documenting years of tech tutorials risked disappearing in “the blink of an eye,” another YouTuber behind a tech tips account called Britec09 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzTjrNYggo"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; after one of his videos was removed.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;The stakes appeared high for everyone, White warned, in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKdalUzydFE"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; titled “YouTube Tech Channels in Danger!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;White had already censored content that he planned to post on his channel, fearing it wouldn’t be worth the risk of potentially losing his account, which began in 2020 as a side hustle but has since become his primary source of income. If he continues to change the content he posts to avoid YouTube penalties, it could hurt his account’s reach and monetization. Britec told Ars that he paused a sponsorship due to the uncertainty that he said has already hurt his channel and caused a “great loss of income.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YouTube’s policies are strict, with the platform known to swiftly remove accounts that receive three strikes for violating community guidelines within 90 days. But, curiously, White had not received any strikes following his content removals. Although Britec reported that his account had received a strike following his video’s removal, White told Ars that YouTube so far had only given him two warnings, so his account is not yet at risk of a ban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Creators weren’t sure why YouTube might deem this content as harmful, so they tossed around some theories. It seemed possible, White suggested in his video, that AI was detecting this content as “piracy,” but that shouldn’t be the case, he claimed, since his guides require users to have a valid license to install Windows 11. He also thinks it’s unlikely that Microsoft prompted the takedowns, suggesting tech content creators have a “love-hate relationship” with the tech company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They don’t like what we’re doing, but I don’t think they’re going to get rid of it,” White told Ars, suggesting that Microsoft “could stop us in our tracks” if it were motivated to end workarounds. But Microsoft doesn’t do that, White said, perhaps because it benefits from popular tutorials that attract swarms of Windows 11 users who otherwise may not use “their flagship operating system” if they can’t bypass Microsoft account requirements.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Those users could become loyal to Microsoft, White said. And eventually, some users may even “get tired of bypassing the Microsoft account requirements, or Microsoft will add a new feature that they’ll happily get the account for, and they’ll relent and start using a Microsoft account,” White suggested in his video. “At least some people will, not me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined Ars’ request to comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To White, it seemed possible that YouTube was leaning on AI  to catch more violations but perhaps recognized the risk of over-moderation and, therefore, wasn’t allowing AI to issue strikes on his account.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that was just a “theory” that he and other creators came up with, but couldn’t confirm, since YouTube’s chatbot that supports creators seemed to also be “suspiciously AI-driven,” seemingly auto-responding even when a “supervisor” is connected, White said in his video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Absent more clarity from YouTube, creators who post tutorials, tech tips, and computer repair videos were spooked. Their biggest fear was that unexpected changes to automated content moderation could unexpectedly knock them off YouTube for posting videos that in tech circles seem ordinary and commonplace, White and Britec said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are not even sure what we can make videos on,” White said. “Everything’s a theory right now because we don’t have anything solid from YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/youtube-denies-ai-was-involved-with-odd-removals-of-tech-tutorials/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;YouTube recommends making the content it’s removing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;White’s channel gained popularity after YouTube highlighted an early trending video that he made, showing a workaround to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware. Following that video, his channel’s views spiked, and then he gradually built up his subscriber base to around 330,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, White’s videos in that category had been flagged as violative, but human review got them quickly reinstated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div&gt;“They were striked for the same reason, but at that time, I guess the AI revolution hadn’t taken over,” White said. “So it was relatively easy to talk to a real person. And by talking to a real person, they were like, ‘Yeah, this is stupid.’ And they brought the videos back.”&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, YouTube suggests that human review is causing the removals, which likely doesn’t completely ease creators’ fears about arbitrary takedowns.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Britec’s video was also flagged as dangerous or harmful. He has managed his account that currently has nearly 900,000 subscribers since 2009, and he’s worried he risked losing “years of hard work,” he said in his video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Britec told Ars that “it’s very confusing” for panicked tech content creators trying to understand what content is permissible. It’s particularly frustrating, he noted in his video, that YouTube’s creator tool inspiring “ideas” for posts seemed to contradict the mods’ content warnings and continued to recommend that creators make content on specific topics like workarounds to install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2125220 align-none"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;                         &lt;img width="640" height="400" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-640x400.jpg" class="none medium" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-640x400.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-2048x1280.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-980x613.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/via-Britec09-1440x900.jpg 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;                   &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;figcaption&gt;         &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Screenshot from Britec09’s YouTube video, showing YouTube prompting creators to make content that could get their channels removed.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                        &lt;a class="caption-credit-link text-gray-400 no-underline hover:text-gray-500" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFzTjrNYggo" target="_blank"&gt;                      via Britec09                        &lt;/a&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/figcaption&gt;       &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“This tool was to give you ideas for your next video,” Britec said. “And you can see right here, it’s telling you to create content on these topics. And if you did this, I can guarantee you your channel will get a strike.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From there, creators hit what White described as a “brick wall,” with one of his appeals denied within one minute, which felt like it must be an automated decision. As Britec explained, “You will appeal, and your appeal will be rejected instantly. You will not be speaking to a human being. You’ll be speaking to a bot or AI. The bot will be giving you automated responses.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;YouTube insisted that the decisions weren’t automated, even when an appeal was denied within one minute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;White told Ars that it’s easy for creators to be discouraged and censor their channels rather than fight with the AI. After wasting “an hour and a half trying to reason with an AI about why I didn’t violate the community guidelines” once his first appeal was quickly denied, he “didn’t even bother using the chat function” after the second appeal was denied even faster, White confirmed in his video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I simply wasn’t going to do that again,” White said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All week, the panic spread, reaching fans who follow tech content creators. On &lt;a class="c-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1oiz0v0/youtube_is_taking_down_videos_on_performing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1oiz0v0/youtube_is_taking_down_videos_on_performing/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, people recommended saving tutorials lest they risk YouTube taking them down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve had people come out and say, ‘This can’t be true. I rely on this every time,'” White told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the reality is that it’s multiple problems. Depending on the properties we need, we form plastics out of different polymers, each of which is held together by a distinct type of chemical bond. So the method we use to break down one type of polymer may be incompatible with the chemistry of another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That problem is why, even though we’ve had success finding enzymes that break down common plastics like &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/using-ai-to-design-proteins-is-now-easy-making-enzymes-remains-hard/"&gt;polyesters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/04/researchers-engineer-enzyme-to-break-down-plastic-bottles/"&gt;PET&lt;/a&gt;, they’re only partial solutions to plastic waste. However, researchers aren’t sitting back and basking in the triumph of partial solutions, and they’ve now got very sophisticated protein design tools to help them out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the story behind a completely new enzyme that researchers developed to break down polyurethane, the polymer commonly used to make foam cushioning, among other things. The new enzyme is compatible with an industrial-style recycling process that breaks the polymer down into its basic building blocks, which can be used to form fresh polyurethane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Breaking down polyurethane&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2125335 align-fullwidth"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;                         &lt;img width="527" height="162" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/urethane.jpg" class="fullwidth full" alt="Image of a set of chemical bonds.

The rest of the polymer is represented by X’s here.            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/figcaption&gt;       &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new paper that describes the development of this enzyme lays out the scale of the problem: In 2024, we made 22 million metric tons of polyurethane. The urethane bond that defines these involves a nitrogen bonded to a carbon that in turn is bonded to two oxygens, one of which links into the rest of the polymer. The rest of the polymer, linked by these bonds, can be fairly complex and often contains ringed structures related to benzene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digesting polyurethanes is challenging. Individual polymer chains are often extensively cross-linked, and the bulky structures can make it difficult for enzymes to get at the bonds they can digest. A chemical called diethylene glycol can partially break these molecules down, but only at elevated temperatures. And it leaves behind a complicated mess of chemicals that can’t be fed back into any useful reactions. Instead, it’s typically incinerated as hazardous waste.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;To find something that could work better, the research team focused on finding an enzyme that could be integrated into the process with diethylene glycol. To begin, they tested all the enzymes reported in the literature as capable of breaking down polyurethanes. After testing all 15 of them, only three had decent activity against the polymer they were testing with, and they largely failed to break the polymer down to its constituent starting materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the researchers focused on the enzyme that had the highest activity, searching for related proteins in public databases, and using the AlphaFold database of predicted structures to identify more distantly related proteins that folded up into a similar structure. On their own, none of these worked especially well either. But they turned out to be useful because they could be used to train an AI to look for sequences that could fold up into a similar structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A new enzyme&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tool the team started working with is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/Wublab/Pythia"&gt;Pythia-Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, which is a neural network that specializes in determining whether any given amino acid in a protein is likely to contact whatever chemicals that structure can bind, along with any other functional features. That was combined with plain old Pythia (also a neural network), which predicts whether any given protein is likely to form a stable structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers reasoned that a good candidate for breaking down polyurethane would have a number of features. It would look, structurally, like the enzyme they had already been working with. It would also face a trade-off between having a structure that was ordered enough to form a similar binding pocket that would have enzymatic activity, but not so rigid that it couldn’t flexibly fit around different types of polyurethanes. To strike this balance, the team used a message-passing interface that updated amino acid positions with each pass and balanced optimizing the structure and binding pocket. They called the resulting software GRASE, for graph neural network-based recommendation of active and stable enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;The results were pretty spectacular. Of the 24 most highly rated proteins the software evaluated, 21 of them showed some catalytic activity, and eight did better than the best enzyme we had known about previously. The best of these designs had 30 times the activity of that enzyme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things got even better when the researchers mixed in the diethylene glycol and heated the mixture up to 50° C. Under those conditions, the newly designed enzyme was over 450 times as active as the best-performing natural enzyme. It took 12 hours, but it could break down 98 percent of the polyurethane in the reaction mixture. And the enzyme was stable enough that it could be given a fresh mixture of polyurethane two additional times before its enzymatic activity started to wear out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shifting from lab tests to kilogram-scale digestion showed the same thing: 95 percent or more of the material was broken down into the starting materials the polyurethane was made from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers highlight the fact that their tools go beyond simply focusing on the structure formed by the protein, but incorporate information about its function, such as its stability and the amino acids that are likely to interact with the material it’s digesting. And they suggest that these approaches may tell us more about how to get functional proteins by focusing on forming a similar 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science, 2025.

Since its introduction, Cursor has supported models developed by other companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. However, while it has trialed its own built-in models, they weren’t competitive with the big frontier models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a different story now, according to the company’s claims about Composer. &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/blog/kernels"&gt;Built with&lt;/a&gt; reinforcement learning and a mixture-of-experts architecture, Composer is dubbed by Cursor “a frontier model that is 4x faster than similarly intelligent models”—a significant claim when you consider what it’s competing with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The emphasis seems to be on speed. In a benchmark chart displaying Cursor’s internal Cursor-Bench for intelligence and tokens per second for speed, Composer underperforms compared to the “best frontier” and outperforms top-tier open models and speed-oriented frontier models in intelligence. However, it vastly outpaces its competitors in speed.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2125317 align-none"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;                         &lt;img width="1024" height="576" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-1024x576.png" class="none large" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-384x216.png 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-1152x648.png 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-980x551.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark-1440x810.png 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Cursor-benchmark.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;                   &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;figcaption&gt;         &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Keep in mind: This is based on an internal benchmark at Cursor.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                        &lt;a class="caption-credit-link text-gray-400 no-underline hover:text-gray-500" href="https://cursor.com/blog/2-0" target="_blank"&gt;                      Cursor                        &lt;/a&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/figcaption&gt;       &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cursor is hoping Composer will perform in terms of accuracy and best practices as well. It wasn’t trained on static datasets but rather interactive development challenges involving a range of agentic tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intriguing claims and strong training methodology aside, it remains to be seen whether Composer will be able to compete with the best frontier models from the big players.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even developers who might be natural users of Cursor would not want to waste much time on an unproven new model when something like Anthropic’s Claude is working just fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To address that, Cursor introduced Composer alongside its new multi-agent interface, which allows you to “run many agents in parallel without them interfering with one another, powered by git worktrees or remote machines”—that means using multiple models at once for the same task and comparing their results, then picking the best one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interface is an invitation to try Composer and let the work speak for itself. We’ll see how devs feel about it in the coming weeks. So far, a non-representative sample of developers I’ve spoken with has told me they feel that Composer is not ineffective, but rather too expensive, given a perceived capability gap with the big models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can see the other new features and fixes for Cursor 2.0 in the &lt;a href="https://cursor.com/changelog/2-0"&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         Both vulnerabilities are being exploited in wide-scale operations.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1024" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/windows-malware-1024x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Getty Images                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;p&gt;Two Windows vulnerabilities—one a zero-day that has been known to attackers since 2017 and the other a critical flaw that Microsoft initially tried and failed to patch recently—are under active exploitation in widespread attacks targeting a swath of the Internet, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zero-day went undiscovered until &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/windows-shortcut-zero-day-exploit.html"&gt;March&lt;/a&gt;, when security firm Trend Micro said it had been under active exploitation since 2017, by as many as 11 separate advanced persistent threats (APTs). These APT groups, often with ties to nation-states, relentlessly attack specific individuals or groups of interest. Trend Micro went on to say that the groups were exploiting the vulnerability, then tracked as ZDI-CAN-25373, to install various known post-exploitation payloads on infrastructure located in nearly 60 countries, with the US, Canada, Russia, and Korea being the most common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A large-scale, coordinated operation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven months later, Microsoft still hasn’t patched the vulnerability, which stems from a bug in the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/16cb4ca1-9339-4d0c-a68d-bf1d6cc0f943"&gt;Windows Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; binary format. The Windows component makes opening apps or accessing files easier and faster by allowing a single binary file to invoke them without having to navigate to their locations. In recent months, the ZDI-CAN-25373 tracking designation has been changed to CVE-2025-9491.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, security firm Arctic Wolf &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/unc6384-weaponizes-zdi-can-25373-vulnerability-to-deploy-plugx/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that it observed a China-aligned threat group, tracked as UNC-6384, exploiting CVE-2025-9491 in attacks against various European nations. The final payload is a widely used remote access trojan known as PlugX. To better conceal the malware, the exploit keeps the binary file encrypted in the RC4 format until the final step in the attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The breadth of targeting across multiple European nations within a condensed timeframe suggests either a large-scale coordinated intelligence collection operation or deployment of multiple parallel operational teams with shared tooling but independent targeting,” Arctic Wolf said. “The consistency in tradecraft across disparate targets indicates centralized tool development and operational security standards even if execution is distributed across multiple teams.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;With no patch available, Windows users are left with a limited number of options for fending off attacks. The most effective countermeasure is locking down .lnk functions by blocking or restricting the usage of .lnk files from untrusted origins. This can be done by setting the Windows Explorer to disable the automatic resolution of such files. The severity rating for CVE-2025-9491 is 7 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other Windows vulnerability was patched last week, when Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59287"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an unscheduled update. CVE-2025-59287 carries a severity rating of 9.8. It resides in the Windows Server Update Services, which administrators use to install, patch, or delete apps on vast fleets of servers. Microsoft previously attempted to patch the potentially wormable remote code execution vulnerability, caused by a serialization flaw, a week earlier in its October Patch Tuesday release. Publicly released proof-of-concept code quickly proved that the attempted fix was incomplete&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around the same time that Microsoft released its second fix, security firm &lt;a href="https://www.huntress.com/blog/exploitation-of-windows-server-update-services-remote-code-execution-vulnerability"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt; said it had observed the WSUS flaw being exploited starting on October 23. Security firm &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/link"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt; reported the same finding shortly after.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Security firm Sophos &lt;a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2025/10/29/windows-server-update-services-wsus-vulnerability-abused-to-harvest-sensitive-data/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that it has also observed CVE-2025-59287 being exploited “in multiple customer environments” since October 24.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The wave of activity, which spanned several hours and targeted internet-facing WSUS servers, impacted customers across a range of industries and did not appear to be targeted attacks,” Sophos said. “It is unclear if the threat actors behind this activity leveraged the public PoC or developed their own exploit.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Administrators should investigate immediately if their devices are vulnerable to either of the ongoing attacks. There’s no indication when Microsoft will release a patch for CVE-2025-9491.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Biden-era FCC found that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law, “affirmatively requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Commission has previously found that section 105 of CALEA creates an affirmative obligation for a telecommunications carrier to avoid the risk that suppliers of untrusted equipment will ‘illegally activate interceptions or other forms of surveillance within the carrier’s switching premises without its knowledge,'” the January order said. “With this Declaratory Ruling, we clarify that telecommunications carriers’ duties under section 105 of CALEA extend not only to the equipment they choose to use in their networks, but also to how they manage their networks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ISPs get what they want&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The declaratory ruling was paired with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would have led to stricter rules requiring specific steps to secure networks against unauthorized interception. Carr voted against the decision at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the declaratory ruling didn’t yet have specific rules to go along with it, the FCC at the time said it had some teeth. “Even absent rules adopted by the Commission, such as those proposed below, we believe that telecommunications carriers would be unlikely to satisfy their statutory obligations under section 105 without adopting certain basic cybersecurity practices for their communications systems and services,” the January order said. “For example, basic cybersecurity hygiene practices such as implementing role-based access controls, changing default passwords, requiring minimum password strength, and adopting multifactor authentication are necessary for any sensitive computer system. Furthermore, a failure to patch known vulnerabilities or to employ best practices that are known to be necessary in response to identified exploits would appear to fall short of fulfilling this statutory obligation.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;Cable, fiber, and mobile operators protested the decision. A &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/102183024015116/1"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; asking the FCC to reverse it was filed in February by CTIA-The Wireless Association, NCTA-The Internet &amp;amp; Television Association, and USTelecom-The Broadband Association. The telecom lobby groups argued that CALEA “obligates providers only to facilitate lawful intercepts from law enforcement,” and that “the FCC lacks authority to promulgate technical standards under Section 105.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-415190A1.pdf"&gt;draft&lt;/a&gt; of the order that will be voted on in November, the FCC said it will “rescind the declaratory ruling as unlawful and unnecessary, finding that the commission’s interpretation of CALEA was legally erroneous and ineffective at promoting cybersecurity.” The order will also withdraw the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, saying that the FCC will try to implement “a targeted approach to promoting effective cybersecurity productions rather than a one-size-fits-all approach of a single rulemaking to govern all Commission licensees.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/fcc-dumps-plan-for-telecom-security-rules-that-internet-providers-dont-like/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Voluntary commitments enough, FCC says&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCC leadership appears to be satisfied that promises from carriers make new rules unnecessary. The draft order said “providers have agreed to implement additional cybersecurity controls to harden their networks. These controls have included accelerated patching of outdated or vulnerable equipment, updating and reviewing access controls, disabling unnecessary outbound connections, and improving their threat-hunting efforts. Providers have also committed to increased cybersecurity information sharing, both with the federal government and within the communications sector. This represents a significant change in cybersecurity practices compared to the measures in place in January.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The order argues that the previous FCC leadership’s reading of CALEA “was unlawful because the FCC purported to read a statute that required telecommunications carriers to allow lawful wiretaps within a certain portion of their network as a provision that required carriers to adopt specific network management practices in every portion of their network.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law says that each “telecommunications carrier shall ensure that any interception of communications or access to call-identifying information effected within its switching premises can be activated only in accordance with a court order or other lawful authorization and with the affirmative intervention of an individual officer or employee of the carrier acting in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;h2&gt;Former chair defended “common sense” ruling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before Trump took over, the FCC argued that the plain text of the law supported the declaratory ruling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By mandating an affirmative duty requiring that carriers ‘shall ensure’ that the ‘only’ interception of communications or access to call-identifying information is that which is conducted pursuant to a lawful authorization and with the affirmative intervention of an individual officer of the carrier acting in accordance with the Commission’s regulations, CALEA obligates carriers to prevent interception of communications or access to call-identifying information by any other means,” the FCC said at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then-Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said the FCC needed to modernize its rules because of attacks like Salt Typhoon. The attack “breached nine domestic telecommunications and Internet service providers” and “compromised devices like routers and switches by exploiting old equipment, facilities that had not been updated, and network components that lacked basic cybersecurity protocols,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCC’s declaratory ruling “makes clear that under Section 105 of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, telecommunications carriers have a legal obligation to secure their networks against unlawful access and interception. This is common sense,” Rosenworcel said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under Carr, the FCC says it can tackle security through a “collaborative” approach via “federal-private partnerships that protect and secure communications networks and more targeted, legally sound rulemaking and enforcement.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Both areas have abysmally low vaccination rates: In Mohave County, only &lt;a href="https://apps.azdhs.gov/IDRREportStats"&gt;78.4 percent of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the 2024–2025 school year were vaccinated against measles, according to state records. In the southwest district of Utah, &lt;a href="https://immunize-training.at.utah.gov/captivate/UtahSchoolsData_Kinder_UpdatedApr2025.html"&gt;only 80.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of kindergartners in the 2024–2025 school year had records of measles vaccination. Public health experts say vaccination coverage of 95 percent is necessary to keep the disease from spreading in a community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the outbreak has largely exploded along the border, cases are also creeping to the north, toward Salt Lake County, which encompasses the city. Utah County, which sits just south of Salt Lake County, has identified eight cases, including &lt;a href="https://health.utahcounty.gov/2025/10/31/new-measles-case-in-utah-county/"&gt;a new case reported today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Uncooperative case&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County likely has a new one, too—the first for the county this year—as well as possible exposures. But, they can’t confirm it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;County health officials said that a health care provider in the area contacted them late on Monday to tell them about a patient who very likely has measles. The officials then spent a day reaching out to the person, who refused to answer questions or cooperate in any way. That included refusing to share location information so that other people could be notified that they were potentially exposed to one of the most infectious viruses known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” Dorothy Adams, executive director of Salt Lake County Health Department, said in &lt;a href="https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/health/news/probable-first-case-of-measles-in-salt-lake-county/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;Measles is extremely infectious. It is spread through the air and can linger in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infectious person has left. Among unvaccinated people, 90 percent will become infected if exposed. Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) are 97 percent effective at preventing the infection, and that protection is considered lifelong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dangerous trends&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Rupp, a spokesperson for the county health department, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/10/29/sl-county-officials-think-they/"&gt;told the Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/a&gt; that officials were at least able to notify people who might have been exposed at the health care provider’s office. However, the patient with the suspected case wouldn’t even share their address with the health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rejection of the health officials’ efforts, as well as the resurgence of a bygone vaccine-preventable illness, reflect growing trends across the country to distrust and disregard public health, as well as embrace anti-vaccine misinformation and rhetoric. These trends have only been exacerbated by the confirmation of prominent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the country’s top health official. Kennedy’s decadeslong work of spreading deadly misinformation about lifesaving vaccines helped set some of these trends into motion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;the US has recorded at least 1,648 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the year, the highest case count in over three decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There have been 43 outbreaks in the country, which account for 87 percent of the cases. The outbreaks and cases have spanned at least 41 states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, meaning it no longer spreads continuously in the country, though it is occasionally introduced by travel-related cases. This elimination status can be lost if the virus is found to have spread continuously over a 12-month period. Given the continued outbreaks and spread amid slipping vaccination rates, health experts expect the US to lose its status in the near future. Canada, which has had similar trends to the US, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-likely-lose-measles-elimination-status-us-rcna240300"&gt;is poised to lose its elimination status this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         New Glenn will soon meet its payloads: Two NASA probes to study Martian climate change.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2hotfire-1152x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2hotfire-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2hotfire-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2hotfire-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2hotfire-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;       Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket fires up its seven BE-4 engines Thursday night.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Blue Origin                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;p&gt;The road to the second flight of Blue Origin’s heavy-lifting New Glenn rocket got a lot clearer Thursday night with a success test-firing of the launcher’s seven main engines on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing on a seaside launch pad, the New Glenn rocket ignited its seven BE-4 main engines at 9:59 pm EDT Thursday (01:59 UTC Friday). The engines burned for 38 seconds while the rocket remained firmly on the ground, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1984096485961613559"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; by Blue Origin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hold-down firing of the first stage engines was the final major test of the New Glenn rocket before launch day. Blue Origin previously test-fired the rocket’s second-stage engines. Officials have not announced a target launch date, but sources tell Ars the rocket could be ready for liftoff as soon as November 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;“Love seeing New Glenn’s seven BE-4 engines come alive! Congratulations to Team Blue on today’s hotfire,” the company’s CEO, Dave Limp, &lt;a href="https://x.com/davill/status/1984094714283585842"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blue Origin, the space company owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, said the engines operated at full power for 22 seconds, generating nearly 3.9 million pounds of thrust. Limp said engineers extended this test-firing and shut down some of the BE-4 engines to simulate the booster’s landing burn sequence, which Blue Origin hopes will culminate in a successful touchdown on a barge floating downrange in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This helps us understand fluid interactions between active and inactive engine feedlines during landing,” Limp wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blue Origin is counting on recovering the New Glenn first stage on the next flight after missing the landing on the rocket’s inaugural mission in January. Officials &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/10/blue-origin-aims-to-land-next-new-glenn-booster-then-reuse-it-for-moon-mission/"&gt;plan to reuse this booster&lt;/a&gt; on the third New Glenn launch early next year, slated to propel Blue Origin’s first unpiloted Blue Moon lander toward the Moon. If Blue Origin fails to land this rocket, it’s unlikely a new first stage booster will be ready to launch until sometime later in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A few more things to do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the test-firing complete, Blue Origin’s ground crew will lower the more than 320-foot-tall (98-meter) rocket and roll it back to a nearby hangar. There, technicians will inspect the vehicle and swap its payload fairing for another clamshell containing two NASA-owned spacecraft set to begin their journey to Mars.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;The twin spacecraft are part of NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, a project aimed at studying the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere of Mars. This interaction drives atmospheric escape, the mechanism by which scientists believe Mars transitioned from a warmer, wetter world into the rust-colored desert planet of today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2125245 align-fullwidth"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;                         &lt;img width="2048" height="1366" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire.jpg" class="fullwidth full" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-980x654.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ng2rolloutprehotfire-1440x960.jpg 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"&gt;                   &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;figcaption&gt;         &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Blue Origin’s second New Glenn rocket rolls to Launch Complex-36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, ahead of a preflight test-firing.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Blue Origin                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/figcaption&gt;       &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NASA is getting a good deal from Blue Origin for the launch of the ESCAPADE mission. The space agency is paying Bezos’ company $20 million for the launch, millions less than a dedicated launch on another rocket. But there’s a trade-off. NASA is accepting more risk on this mission because it’s just the second flight of the New Glenn rocket, which hasn’t yet been certified by NASA or the US Space Force for high-priority government launches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials are fine with that because ESCAPADE is part of a new family of relatively low-cost Solar System missions. The mission’s total cost amounts to less than $80 million, an order of magnitude lower than all of NASA’s recent Mars missions. At this cost, NASA managers can live with a little more risk than they would for an $800 million mission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Normally, Mars missions can launch from the Earth for only a few weeks about once every 26 months, when the planets are in the right position for a spacecraft to make a direct trip. ESCAPADE is launching outside of the normal Mars interplanetary window, so the twin probes will &lt;a href="https://escapade.ssl.berkeley.edu/mission-design/"&gt;loiter relatively close to the Earth&lt;/a&gt; until next November, when they will fire their engines to set off for the red planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ESCAPADE spacecraft, built by Rocket Lab, come nowhere close to filling the New Glenn rocket’s lift capacity. The fully fueled satellites combine to weigh a little more than a ton, about 15 percent of the total payload the rocket could deploy on ESCAPADE’s initial departure trajectory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two spacecraft will arrive at Mars in September 2027 and begin their science observations a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Full of &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/not-just-a-semi-announcement-tesla-promises-a-new-roadster/"&gt;nonsensical-sounding features&lt;/a&gt; that impressed people who know a little bit about rockets but nothing about cars, the $200,000 electric car promised to have a suction fan and &amp;#8220;cold gas thrusters,&amp;#8221; plus 620 miles (1,000 km) of range and a whole load of other stuff that&amp;#8217;s never happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plenty of other electric automakers have introduced electric hypercars in the eight years since Musk declared the second Roadster a thing, with no sign of it being any closer to reality, &lt;a href="https://carbuzz.com/tesla-roadster-early-development/"&gt;if the latest job postings are accurate&lt;/a&gt;. And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk&amp;#8217;s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman&amp;#8217;s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today&amp;#8217;s money). But after emailing Tesla for a refund, he discovered the email address associated with preorders had been deleted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="ars-wp-img-shortcode id-2125255 align-fullwidth"&gt;     &lt;div&gt;                         &lt;img width="599" height="485" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-2.10.59-PM.png" class="fullwidth full" alt="A screenshot of Sam Altman&amp;#039;s X posts about cancelling his car" decoding="async" loading="lazy" /&gt;                   &lt;/div&gt;           &lt;figcaption&gt;         &lt;div     class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_7px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Twitter                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;       &lt;/figcaption&gt;       &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps Altman forgot to ask ChatGPT how best to go about getting his money. If he had, he might have stumbled across the experience of streamer Marques Brownlee, &lt;a href="https://www.theautopian.com/good-luck-trying-to-get-your-entire-tesla-roadster-deposit-back/"&gt;who eventually had to pick up a telephone&lt;/a&gt; and call someone to get most of his $50,000 back. Or perhaps some of the threads at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/18d9y0g/cancelling_roadster_reservations/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/how-to-actually-cancel-a-reservation.302126/"&gt;Tesla forums&lt;/a&gt;, where other people who fell for the cold gas thruster-equipped two-seater with Lucid-busting range and F1-beating acceleration have gathered to share stories of how best to make Tesla return their money.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         National Advertising Division said AT&amp;#038;T ad and press release broke program rule.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty-att-logo-1152x648-1745953050.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="A large AT&amp;amp;T logo seen on the outside of its corporate offices." loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty-att-logo-1152x648-1745953050.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty-att-logo-384x216-1745953049.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty-att-logo-768x432-1745953050.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getty-att-logo-1536x864-1745953051.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Getty Images | AaronP/Bauer-Griffin                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="" name="page-1" data-page="1" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-sues-ad-industry-watchdog-instead-of-pulling-ads-that-slam-t-mobile/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T yesterday sued the advertising industry’s official watchdog over the group’s demand that AT&amp;amp;T stop using its rulings for advertising and promotional purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-ad-congratulating-itself-for-its-ethics-violated-an-ad-industry-rule/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, BBB National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD) found that AT&amp;amp;T violated a rule “by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes,” and sent a cease-and-desist letter to the carrier. The NAD operates the US advertising industry’s system of self-regulation, which is designed to handle complaints that advertisers file against each other and minimize government regulation of false and misleading claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it’s clear that both AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have a history of misleading ad campaigns, AT&amp;amp;T portrays itself as a paragon of honesty in new ads calling T-Mobile “the master of breaking promises.” An AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/att-stands-up-for-consumers.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about the ad campaign said the NAD “asked T-Mobile to correct their marketing claims 16 times over the last four years,” and an AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EHkISq0p9Q"&gt;commercial&lt;/a&gt; said T-Mobile has faced more challenges for deceptive ads from competitors than all other telecom providers in that time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the NAD describes AT&amp;amp;T’s actions as a clear-cut violation of rules that advertisers agree to in the self-regulatory process, AT&amp;amp;T disputed the accusation in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.411145/gov.uscourts.txnd.411145.1.0.pdf"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas. “We stand by our campaign to shine a light on deceptive advertising from our competitors and oppose demands to silence the truth,” AT&amp;amp;T said in a &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/att-files-lawsuit.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s lawsuit asked the court for a declaration, stating “that it has not violated NAD’s procedures” and that “NAD has no legal basis to enforce its demand for censorship.” The lawsuit complained that AT&amp;amp;T hasn’t been able to run its advertisements widely because “NAD’s inflammatory and baseless accusations have now intimidated multiple TV networks into pulling AT&amp;amp;T’s advertisement.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T claims rule no longer applies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s claim that it didn’t violate an NAD rule hinges partly on when its press release was issued. The carrier claims the rule against referencing NAD decisions only applies for a short period of time after each NAD ruling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NAD now takes the remarkable position that any former participant in an NAD proceeding is forever barred from truthfully referencing NAD’s own public findings about a competitor’s deceptive advertising,” AT&amp;amp;T said. The lawsuit argued that “if NAD’s procedures were ever binding on AT&amp;amp;T, their binding effect ceased at the conclusion of the proceeding or a reasonable time thereafter.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also slammed the NAD for failing to rein in T-Mobile’s deceptive ads. The group’s slow process let T-Mobile air deceptive advertisements without meaningful consequences, and the “NAD has repeatedly failed to refer continued violations to the FTC,” AT&amp;amp;T said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the past several years, NAD has repeatedly deemed T-Mobile’s ads to be misleading, false, or unsubstantiated,” AT&amp;amp;T said. “But over and over, T-Mobile has gamed the system to avoid timely redressing its behavior. NAD’s process is often slow, and T-Mobile knows it can make that process even slower by asking for extensions and delaying fixes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve reported extensively on both carriers’ history of misleading advertisements over the years. That includes T-Mobile promising never to raise prices on certain plans and then &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/i-am-still-alive-users-say-t-mobile-must-pay-for-killing-lifetime-price-lock/"&gt;raising them anyway&lt;/a&gt;. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/05/att-still-refuses-to-kill-misleading-5ge-network-icon-for-4g-service/"&gt;used to advertise&lt;/a&gt; 4G LTE service as “5GE,” and was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/att-rebuked-over-misleading-ad-for-nonexistent-satellite-phone-calling/"&gt;rebuked for an ad&lt;/a&gt; that falsely claimed the carrier was already offering cellular coverage from space. AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile have both &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/att-users-whose-unlimited-data-was-throttled-get-60-million-in-refunds/"&gt;gotten in trouble&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/big-three-carriers-pay-10m-to-settle-claims-of-false-unlimited-advertising/"&gt;misleading promises of unlimited data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/att-sues-ad-industry-watchdog-instead-of-pulling-ads-that-slam-t-mobile/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says vague ad didn’t violate rule&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s lawsuit alleged that the NAD press release “intentionally impl[ied] that AT&amp;amp;T mischaracterized NAD’s prior decisions about T-Mobile’s deceptive advertising.” However, the NAD’s public stance is that AT&amp;amp;T violated the rule by using NAD decisions for promotional purposes, not by mischaracterizing the decisions.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bbbprograms.org/getmedia/133fded6-5046-44de-a30e-f0890377480c/NAD-NARB-Procedures.pdf"&gt;NAD procedures&lt;/a&gt; state that companies participating in the system agree “not to mischaracterize any decision, abstract, or press release issued or use and/or disseminate such decision, abstract or press release for advertising and/or promotional purposes.” The NAD &lt;a href="https://bbbprograms.org/media/newsroom/press/att-violates-procedures"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make any specific allegations of AT&amp;amp;T mischaracterizing its decisions but said that AT&amp;amp;T violated the rules “by issuing a video advertisement and press release that use the NAD process and its findings for promotional purposes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NAD said AT&amp;amp;T committed a “direct violation” of the rules by running an ad and issuing a press release “making representations regarding the alleged results of a competitor’s participation in BBB National Program’s advertising industry self-regulatory process.” The “alleged results” phrase may be why AT&amp;amp;T is claiming the NAD accused it of mischaracterizing decisions. There could also be more specific allegations in the cease-and-desist letter, which wasn’t made public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T claims its TV ads about T-Mobile don’t violate the rule because they only refer to “challenges” to T-Mobile advertising and “do not &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; any decision, abstract, or press release.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;AT&amp;amp;T quibbles over rule meaning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T further argues that a press release can’t violate the prohibition against using NAD decisions “for advertising and/or promotional purposes.” While press releases are clearly promotional in nature, AT&amp;amp;T says that part of the NAD rules doesn’t apply to press releases issued by advertisers like itself. Specifically, AT&amp;amp;T said that “the permissibility of press releases is not governed by Section 2.1(I)(2)(b), which applies to uses ‘for advertising and/or promotional purposes.'”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the NAD procedures also bar participants in the process from issuing certain kinds of press releases. AT&amp;amp;T describes the rule about press releases as being in a different section than the rule about advertising and promotional purposes, but it’s actually all part of the same sentence. The rule says, “By participating in an NAD or NARB proceeding, the parties agree: (a) not to issue a press release regarding any decisions issued; and/or (b) not to mischaracterize any decision, abstract or press release issued or use and/or disseminate such decision, abstract or press release for advertising and/or promotional purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T argues that the rule only bars press releases at the time of each NAD decision. The rule’s “meaning is clear in context: When NAD or NARB [National Advertising Review Board] issues a decision, no party is allowed to issue a press release to announce that decision,” AT&amp;amp;T said. “Instead, NAD issues its own press release to announce the decision. AT&amp;amp;T did not issue a press release to announce any decision, and indeed its advertisements (and press release announcing its advertising campaign) do not mention any particular NAD decision. In fact, AT&amp;amp;T’s press release does not use the word ‘decision’ at all.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AT&amp;amp;T said that because it only made a short reference to NAD decisions, “AT&amp;amp;T’s press release about its new advertising campaign is therefore not a press release about an NAD decision as contemplated by Section 2.1(I)(2)(a).” AT&amp;amp;T also said it’s not a violation because the press release simply stated the number of rulings against T-Mobile and did not specifically cite any of those 16 decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“AT&amp;amp;T’s press release does not include, attach, copy, or even cite any specific decision, abstract, or press release either in part or in whole,” AT&amp;amp;T’s lawsuit said. AT&amp;amp;T further said the NAD rule doesn’t apply to any proceeding AT&amp;amp;T wasn’t involved in, and that “AT&amp;amp;T did not initiate several of the proceedings against T-Mobile included in the one-sentence reference.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We contacted the NAD about AT&amp;amp;T’s lawsuit but the group declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
