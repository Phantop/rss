      <description>&lt;p&gt;         More than half its profit came from emissions credits as sales fell 8.6 percent.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2205801667-1152x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="Protesters gather at the Tesla dealership in Chesterfield, Mo., on March 22, 2025." loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2205801667-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2205801667-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2205801667-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2205801667-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;       Protesters gather at the Tesla dealership in Chesterfield, Mo., on March 22, 2025.                 &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Sophia Scheller/NurPhoto via Getty Images                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;p&gt;Tesla published its financial results for 2025 this afternoon. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/"&gt;If 2024 was a bad year&lt;/a&gt; for the electric automaker, 2025 was far worse: For the first time in Tesla’s history, revenues fell year over year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A bad quarter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2026/01/tesla-sales-fell-by-9-percent-in-2025-its-second-yearly-decline/"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla revealed its sales and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2025, with a 16 percent decline compared to Q4 2024. Now we know the cost of those lost sales: Automotive revenues fell by 11 percent to $17.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happily for Tesla, double-digit growth in its energy storage business ($3.8 billion, an increase of 25 percent) and services ($3.4 billion, an increase of 18 percent) made up some of the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although total revenue for the quarter fell by 3 percent, Tesla’s operating profits grew by 20 percent. But declining income from operations, which also got much more expensive, saw Tesla’s net profit plummet 61 percent, to $840 million. Without the $542 million from regulatory credits, things would have looked even bleaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A bad 2025&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selling 1,636,129 cars in 2025 generated $69.5 billion in revenue, 10 percent less than Tesla’s 2024 revenue. But storage and energy increased 27 percent year over year to $12.7 billion, and services grew by 19 percent year over year to $12.5 billion. Together, these two divisions now contribute meaningful amounts to the business, unlike just a few short years ago.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;As a result, total revenues for 2025 only fell by 3 percent. But Tesla saw a 38 percent drop in income from operations, and its expenses went up by 23 percent. As a result, the company’s once-envied profit margin was just 4.9 percent for the year, down from 7.2 percent last year. (In 2022, Tesla had a 23.8 percent profit margin.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consequently, its $3.8 billion net profit for the year was a reduction of 46 percent compared to 2024. Tesla blames falling sales and lower regulatory credits for its decreased revenue and falling profits, despite those regulatory credits contributing $2 billion—52 percent of its annual net profit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were few specifics in the outlook section of &lt;a href="https://assets-ir.tesla.com/tesla-contents/IR/TSLA-Q4-2025-Update.pdf"&gt;Tesla’s presentation&lt;/a&gt; to its investors. It claims that this year will see volume production of its two-seat Cybercab robotaxi, the long-delayed Tesla Semi class 8 truck, and its next Megabuck energy storage system. Tesla also says it expects its investment in AI to start contributing to its annual profit, although elsewhere in the presentation, we learned that the company recently agreed to invest $2 billion into xAI, the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/eu-launches-formal-investigation-of-xai-over-groks-sexualized-deepfakes/"&gt;deepfake-&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/xai-silent-after-grok-sexualized-images-of-kids-dril-mocks-groks-apology/"&gt;CSAM-generating&lt;/a&gt; company owned by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         One of the last holdouts for ransomware discussions, RAMP is taken down.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1100" height="619" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="Ethernet cables accompanies by an exclamation points inside a triangle." loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage.jpg 1100w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/network-outage-980x551.jpg 980w" sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Getty Images                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;p&gt;RAMP—the predominantly Russian-language online bazaar that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed”—had its dark web and clear web sites seized by the FBI as the agency tries to combat the growing scourge threatening critical infrastructure and organizations around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visits to both sites on Wednesday returned pages that said the FBI had taken control of the RAMP domains, which mirrored each other. RAMP has been among the dwindling number of online crime forums to operate with impunity, following the takedown of other forums such as XSS, which saw its leader arrested &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/who-got-arrested-in-the-raid-on-the-xss-crime-forum/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; by Europol. The vacuum left RAMP as one of the leading places for people pushing ransomware and other online threats to buy, sell, or trade products and services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;I regret to inform you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized RAMP,” a banner carrying the seals of the FBI and the Justice Department said. “This action has been taken in coordination with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice.” The banner included a graphic that appeared on the RAMP site, before it was seized, that billed itself as the “only place ransomware allowed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="386" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-640x386.jpg" class="center medium" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-640x386.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-768x463.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-1536x926.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-980x591.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure-1440x868.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramp-fbi-seizure.jpg 2004w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               Screenshot                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;RAMP was founded in 2012 and rebranded in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/08/20/selling-ransomware-breaches-4-trends-spotted-on-the-ramp-forum/"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; security firm Rapid 7. The platform served Russian, Chinese, and English speakers and counted more than 14,000 registered users, who underwent strict vetting before being accepted or paid a $500 fee for anonymous participation. The forum provided discussion groups, cyberattack tutorials, and a marketplace for malware and services. Its chief administrator said in 2024 the site earned $250,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;In a message posted to a rebranded XSS site, a purported RAMP member announced the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post.jpg"&gt;&lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="187" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post-640x187.jpg" class="center medium" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post-640x187.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post-1024x300.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post-768x225.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post-980x287.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/stallman-post.jpg 1264w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                                              &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       XSS                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Translated from Russian, the post read:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closure of the Ramp forum&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To all those concerned:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I regret to inform you that the police authorities have taken control of the Ramp forum. This event has destroyed years of my work building the freest forum in the world, and while I hoped this day would never come, I always knew in my heart it was possible. It’s a risk we all take.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I no longer manage Ramp and will not be creating a new forum from scratch, I will continue to purchase access. My main business remains unchanged…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone, take care of yourselves and your loved ones,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stallman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no word of arrests or detentions of any RAMP operators or users. The seizure notice invited people to submit tips through the FBI’s IC3 portal. US authorities have yet to release a statement mentioning the takedown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DNS records show that servers resolving the RAMP domain now belong to the FBI. It’s not known if the agents now have access to user databases and other sensitive site information. If so, site users who weren’t careful may be tracked down by law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Teachers and students can get the same apps for $3 a month, or $30 a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bundle includes either access to or enhanced features for a total of 10 Apple apps, though the base versions of several of these are available for free to all Mac and iPad owners:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Final Cut Pro&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Logic Pro&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Keynote, Pages, and Numbers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Motion, Compressor, and MainStage (Mac only)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;When companies introduce a subscription-based model for long-standing apps with an established user base, they often shift &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; to a subscription model, offering continuous updates in return for a more consistent revenue stream. But these aren’t always popular with subscription-fatigued users, who have seen virtually all major paid software shift to a subscription model in the last 10 or 15 years, and who in recent years have had to deal with prices that are &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/home-microsoft-365-plans-use-copilot-ai-features-as-pretext-for-a-price-hike/"&gt;continuously&lt;/a&gt; being &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/spotify-to-raise-subscription-prices-by-up-to-2-in-february/"&gt;ratcheted upward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple’s subscription shift looks a little less like Adobe’s approach to Photoshop and a little more like Microsoft’s approach to Office: many of these apps, particularly the Mac versions, will remain available for free or as standalone one-time purchases from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In lieu of running through each of these apps’ new features one by one, we’ve gathered answers to some questions about how the new subscriptions will work and how they’ll compare to the standalone versions of the apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What apps are still available individually?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple still offers Mac App Store versions of the following apps as one-time purchases:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12"&gt;Final Cut Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($300)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro/id634148309?mt=12"&gt;Logic Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($200)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator-pro/id1289583905?mt=12"&gt;Pixelmator Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($50)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/compressor/id424390742?mt=12"&gt;Compressor&lt;/a&gt; ($50)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/motion/id434290957?mt=12"&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt; ($50)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mainstage/id634159523?mt=12"&gt;MainStage&lt;/a&gt; ($30)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;If you’ve already bought those apps from the Mac App Store at any point in the past, you’ll still have access to them, and they’ll be updated to the current versions at no charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Mac users are generally pretty well taken care of here, current iPad users of Final Cut Pro or Logic are getting the short end of the stick. When those apps were &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/apple-brings-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-to-ipad-as-50-per-year-subscriptions/"&gt;initially introduced on the iPad&lt;/a&gt;, they cost $5 per app per month, or $50 per year per app. Those standalone subscriptions appear to have been axed with the introduction of the Creator Studio bundle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The downside of Apple’s all-or-nothing pricing is that the bundle is only a great value if you actually intend to use multiple apps on multiple platforms regularly. People who are already splitting their time between the Mac and the iPad and using more than one of these apps will get a lot of value for their money; anyone who just wants to run Final Cut Pro on their iPad is looking at a big price hike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Will standalone apps be updated?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="2570" height="1666" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM.jpeg" class="fullwidth full" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM.jpeg 2570w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-640x415.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-1024x664.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-768x498.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-1536x996.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-2048x1328.jpeg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-980x635.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.08.33-PM-1440x933.jpeg 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2570px) 100vw, 2570px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               The standalone apps and Creator Studio apps will mostly be updated in lockstep, but there are some weirdnesses—like the bifurcation of the “old” and “new” versions of the apps formerly known as iWork.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       Andrew Cunningham                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The short answer is “yes, the standalone versions of these apps will generally be updated in lockstep with the Creator Studio versions.” But Apple is taking slightly different approaches depending on the app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the Apple Creator Studio apps are brand-new versions with new version numbers: Final Cut Pro jumps &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/whats-new-ver19637ebab/mac"&gt;from version 11 to version 12&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and Keynote, Pages, and Numbers (apps I still think of collectively as “iWork” despite that name being &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/review-the-productivity-suite-formerly-known-as-iwork/"&gt;well over a decade out of date&lt;/a&gt;) are being bumped from version 14 to version 15. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125029"&gt;Apple’s Creator Studio support document&lt;/a&gt; lists all of the new version numbers.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;For the paid apps, these new versions will be downloaded and installed just as previous Mac App Store updates have been. The standalone Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Compressor, Motion, and MainStage apps have already been updated to the new version numbers, and installing any of them will pull down the latest version.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the standalone version of Pixelmator Pro is still listed as the old version, 3.7.1, while the new version 4.0 requires a Creator Studio subscription. It’s not clear whether that’s going to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, the iOS and iPadOS versions of the new apps will be seamlessly installed in place of the old apps. But it’s being handled slightly differently on the Mac for some reason. All three apps now have two versions listed in the app store: the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote-14-5/id409183694?mt=12%20Keynote%2014.5"&gt;old ones&lt;/a&gt;, set at version 14.5, and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote-design-presentations/id361285480"&gt;the new ones&lt;/a&gt;, set at 15.1. Installing the 14.5 update, which was released today, adds a prompt when you launch the old apps, informing you that they’re out of date and that you should install the new ones instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The subscription apps don’t replace the standalone apps&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1192" height="790" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM.jpeg" class="fullwidth full" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM.jpeg 1192w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM-640x424.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.09.02-PM-980x649.jpeg 980w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               The Creator Studio and paid standalone apps can coexist on the same Mac, if that’s something you want or need.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       Andrew Cunningham                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Users can have both the standalone and Creator Studio versions of all apps installed on their devices at the same time. You’ll be able to tell both versions apart using their icons—the standalone apps keep the same icons they had before, and the Creator Studio versions get the &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/thoughts_and_observations_regarding_apple_creator_studio"&gt;occasionally controversial&lt;/a&gt; high-contrast Liquid Glass-ified redesigns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incidentally, you can also tell the versions of the apps apart by their App Store listings. The standalone ones are just referred to by their names (i.e., “Final Cut Pro,” “Logic Pro”) while the new ones have more modern obnoxious search-optimized titles (“Final Cut Pro: Create Video,” “Logic Pro: Make Music,” “Keynote: Design Presentations”).&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/seven-things-to-know-about-how-apples-creator-studio-subscriptions-work/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the standalone apps missing?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="2370" height="1718" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM.jpeg" class="fullwidth full" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM.jpeg 2370w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-640x464.jpeg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-1024x742.jpeg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-768x557.jpeg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-1536x1113.jpeg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-2048x1485.jpeg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-980x710.jpeg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-4.10.52-PM-1440x1044.jpeg 1440w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2370px) 100vw, 2370px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               In Keynote, Pages, and Numbers, trying to use any “premium” features in the free apps will prompt you to subscribe.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       Andrew Cunningham                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The brightest dividing line between the standalone and Creator Studio apps is for the free ones, Keynote, Pages, and Numbers. All three look the same whether you have an active subscription or not, but the free versions will prompt you to upgrade to Creator Studio any time you attempt to use “premium” features, which as of this writing includes document templates and generative AI features.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Creator Studio subscription is also required to access the “Content Hub,” a library of stock images available only in the Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps (at least for now; they should also be available in Freeform “later this year”). Apple may expand the Content Hub with video and audio content suitable for Final Cut Pro or Logic at some point in the future, but it’s not something the company is offering right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least as of this writing, the paid standalone Mac apps don’t appear to be missing any major features relative to the Creator Studio versions. There’s no way to know whether this will change except to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sharing and device limits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Apple Creator Studio subscription can be shared among up to six Apple accounts using Family Sharing, potentially defraying the cost of the subscription further. This only applies to the standard version of the subscription; education subscriptions can’t be shared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple accounts attached to an active subscription can install the apps on up to 10 devices simultaneously. This is a relatively generous allotment compared to &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/download-install/apps/licensing-activation/activate-deactivate-apps/install-apps-number-of-computers.html"&gt;Adobe’s Creative Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, which just allows installation on two devices at once and only allows the apps to be used on a single system at a time.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;h2&gt;System requirements and other restrictions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple outlines detailed system requirements for each app on its support page &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/125029"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For most of the Mac apps, all you need is a Mac running macOS 15.6 Sequoia or later; the only Mac app that requires macOS 26 Tahoe is Pixelmator Pro. Most of the apps will also run on either Intel or Apple Silicon Macs, though MainStage is Apple Silicon-exclusive, and “some features” in Compressor may also require Apple Silicon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The requirements for the iPad apps are a little more restrictive; you generally need to be running either iPadOS 18.6 or iPadOS 26, and both Final Cut Pro and Pixelmator Pro either want an Apple M1, an Apple A16, or an Apple A17 Pro (in other words, it will work on every iPad Apple currently sells, but older iPad hardware is more hit or miss).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple also outlines a number of usage restrictions for the generative AI features that rely on external services. Apple says that, “at a minimum,” users will be able to generate 50 images, 50 presentations of between 8 to 10 slides each, and to generate presenter notes in Keynote for 700 slides. More usage may be possible, but this depends on “the complexity of the queries, server availability, and network availability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These AI features are all based on OpenAI technology, but don’t require users to have their own OpenAI or ChatGPT account (the flip side is that if you already pay for ChatGPT, that won’t benefit you here). Apple also says that the content you use to generate images, presentations, or notes “will never be used to train intelligence models.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What apps aren’t getting new versions?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are three major creative apps that Apple offers that haven’t been bundled into Creator Studio, and also haven’t gotten a major new update: iMovie, GarageBand, and Photomator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are extenuating circumstances that explain why these three apps haven’t been given a Creator Studio-style overhaul. The iMovie and GarageBand apps have always sort of been positioned as “lite” free-to-use versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, respectively, while Photomator is a recently acquired app that overlaps somewhat with the built-in Photos app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple has nothing to share about the future of any of the three apps. Both iMovie and Photomator received minor updates today, presumably related to maintaining compatibility with the Creator Studio apps, and GarageBand was last updated a month ago. Expect them to stick around in their current forms for at least a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The book has been adapted for film three times since its publication and also inspired the Emmy-nominated TV series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowjackets_(TV_series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yellowjackets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (renewed for its fourth and final season this year). This BBC miniseries apparently has the support of the Golding family and is expected to hew quite closely to the novel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Spoilers for t&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies"&gt;he 1954 novel&lt;/a&gt; below.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Golding was inspired to write &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; by a popular, pro-colonialism children’s novel called &lt;em&gt;The Coral Island&lt;/em&gt;, whose central theme was the civilizing influence of British colonial efforts and Christianity on a “savage” people. Golding wanted to write a book about children on an island who “behave the way children really would behave.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;, a British airplane evacuating a group of young boys from war-torn England crashes on an isolated, uninhabited island. A boy named Ralph finds a conch shell and uses it as a horn, commanding enough respect for the boys to look to him as their chief. Initially, Ralph’s leadership helps the stranded boys establish sufficient order to survive and keep a signal fire going, thanks to the lenses in Piggy’s glasses. But that tenuous order soon begins to fray, with the community splitting into two tribes, the second led by the wilder Jack. Violence inevitably breaks out, resulting in the deaths of two of the boys. Eventually, the survivors are rescued by a British naval ship, and the boys are forced to confront the “end of innocence.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; has remained relevant ever since its publication as a cautionary, if cynical, tale about how social hierarchies can break down into tribal violence, although it should be noted that a real 1965 incident with stranded Tongan boys exemplified the exact opposite effect. &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; is a novel, not a sociological treatise. But its broad cultural influence is undeniable. Stephen King even named his fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine, after Jack’s mountain camp in &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winston Sawyers stars as Ralph in the BBC miniseries, with Lox Pratt playing Jack and David McKenna playing Piggy. The cast also includes Ike Talbot as Simon; Thomas Connor as Roger; Noah Flemyng as Sam; Cassius Flemyng as Eric; Cornelius Brandreth as Maurice; Tom Page-Turner as Bill;’ Rafael de Belligny as Robert; Freddie Lee-Gray as Percival; Beau Thompson as Philip; Fred Jones as Johnny;  and Lake Coleman as Boy with Birthmark. In addition, more than 20 other young boys were cast (many with no acting experience) to play the camp’s “big ‘uns” and “little ‘uns.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; debuts in the UK on BBC One on February 8, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         SpaceX won&amp;#8217;t make specific promises on Starlink network capacity or subscribers.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starlink-snow-1152x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="Snow and ice cover part of a Starlink satellite dish." loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starlink-snow-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starlink-snow-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starlink-snow-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/starlink-snow-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;       A Starlink user terminal during winter.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Getty Images | AntaresNS                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="" name="page-1" data-page="1" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX has made a new set of demands on state governments that would ensure Starlink receives federal grant money even when residents don’t purchase Starlink broadband service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX said it will provide “all necessary equipment” to receive broadband “at no cost to subscribers requesting service,” which will apparently eliminate the up-front hardware fee for Starlink equipment. But SpaceX isn’t promising lower-than-usual monthly prices to consumers in those subsidized areas. SpaceX pledged to make broadband available for $80 or less a month, plus taxes and fees, to people with low incomes in the subsidized areas. For comparison, the normal Starlink residential prices advertised on its &lt;a href="https://starlink.com/residential"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; range from $50 to $120 a month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s demands would also guarantee that it gets paid by the government even if it doesn’t reserve “large portions” of Starlink network capacity for homes in the areas that are supposed to receive government-subsidized Internet service. Moreover, SpaceX would not be responsible for ensuring that Starlink equipment is installed correctly at each customer location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX sent a letter to state broadband offices proposing a rider with terms that it hopes will be applied to all grants it receives throughout the country. The letter was obtained and published by &lt;a href="https://www.broadband.io/c/get-broadband-grant-alerts-news/rider-from-starlink-caveats-promised-service-and-demands-special-dispensation"&gt;Broadband.io&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.benton.org/blog/spacex-seeks-exemption-certain-bead-requirements"&gt;Benton Institute for Broadband &amp;amp; Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arguing that SpaceX should receive grant money regardless of whether residents purchase Starlink service, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SPACE-X-RIDER-LETTER.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to states said that grant payments should not depend on “the independent purchasing decisions of users.” SpaceX also said it will not hold “large portions of capacity fallow” to ensure that people in subsidized areas receive good service, but will instead continue its preexisting practice of “dynamically allocat[ing] capacity where needed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SpaceX capitalizes on Trump overhaul&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LEO-CAPACITY-SUBGRANT-AGREEMENT-RIDER.pdf"&gt;proposed contract rider&lt;/a&gt; would apply to grants distributed under the US government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program. BEAD was created by Congress in a 2021 law that authorized spending over $42 billion to make broadband networks available in areas without modern service.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;While the Biden administration designed the program to prioritize fiber deployments, the Trump administration threw out the previous plans. Under Trump, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) deemed the Biden-era plan too costly and changed the rules to make it easier for satellite services to obtain grant funding. The overhaul cut projected spending to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/us-states-could-lose-21-billion-of-broadband-grants-after-trump-overhaul/"&gt;about $21 billion,&lt;/a&gt; and it’s still unclear what will happen to the other $21 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starlink &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/starlink-wants-billions-in-grants-but-state-governments-arent-cooperating/"&gt;sought billions in grants&lt;/a&gt; after the new rules were put in place, but states didn’t want to provide that much. So far, SpaceX is &lt;a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMTMyZmRhNzMtNWY5NC00OTlmLTgxNjEtZjA1OTFlNWIxZTE2IiwidCI6IjVhMjNkMTNlLTBhM2UtNDI5MS04ZDMzLTM5N2Y2YTEwZjEwYiJ9"&gt;slated to receive&lt;/a&gt; $733.5 million to offer broadband at 472,600 locations. Amazon’s Leo satellite service (formerly Kuiper) is set to receive $311 million for 415,000 locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While not every state plan is final, it looks like satellite networks will get about 5 percent of the grant money and serve over 22 percent of the locations funded by grants. Satellite companies are getting smaller payments on a per-location basis because, unlike fiber providers, they don’t have to install infrastructure at each customer’s location.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concessions sought by SpaceX “would limit Starlink’s performance obligations, payment schedules, non-compliance penalties, reporting expectations, and labor and insurance standards,” wrote Drew Garner, director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute. Garner argued that SpaceX’s demands illustrate problems in how the Trump NTIA rewrote program rules to increase reliance on low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“BEAD was designed primarily to deploy terrestrial networks, which are physically located in communities, built with traditional construction methods, and are relatively easy to monitor and inspect,” Garner wrote. “But, on June 6, 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.ntia.gov/other-publication/2025/bead-restructuring-policy-notice"&gt;NTIA restructured BEAD&lt;/a&gt; in ways that greatly increased participation by LEO providers, exacerbating the challenge of applying BEAD’s terrestrial-focused rules to LEO’s extraterrestrial networks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SpaceX: Labor rules shouldn’t apply to us&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other things, SpaceX is trying to “minimize states’ ability to penalize LEO grantees for defaulting or failing to comply with contract requirements,” and avoid having “to report on the use of BEAD funds or other financial information related to the grant,” Garner wrote.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s letter said that “all requirements related to labor issues (e.g., prevailing wage and similar obligations), contractors, and procurement are inapplicable to SpaceX” because “there are no identifiable employees, contractors, or contracts being funded” to support Starlink broadband service in each state. Similarly, “there are no identifiable pieces of SpaceX infrastructure equipment (other than satellite capacity delivered from Space) being funded via BEAD,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s unclear whether SpaceX will turn down grants if it doesn’t get what it wants. We asked the company for information on its plans if states refuse its terms and will update this article if we get a response. SpaceX’s proposed terms could also be applied to Amazon if states accept them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s letter said that despite the Trump administration’s changes to BEAD, “a number of issues remain that, if unaddressed, could render LEO participation in the program untenable.” SpaceX said it wants to work with states “to more fully tailor aspects of the project agreement to the reality of LEO deployment and operations now that the initial project selection and approval phase is accomplished.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Space said it wants to avoid extensive negotiations over its proposed terms. But the acknowledgement that some negotiation may be necessary seems to recognize that states don’t have to comply with the demands:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward this goal, we have developed a set of terms that we intend to function as a rider to all subgrant agreements across the country. This rider is intentionally limited in scope to addressing items of critical importance, to minimize the need for negotiation, and provide clarity to both parties moving forward. Our intention is for the LEO rider to enable the state to keep its core subgrant agreement relatively uniform amongst grantees, retain state-law-specific requirements, co-locate all relevant LEO-specific material for ease of administration, and standardize agreements across states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/starlink-demands-grant-money-from-states-even-when-residents-dont-buy-service/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Low-income plan: $80 plus taxes and fees&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s proposed contract rider said the firm will offer broadband plans for “a monthly cost of $80 or less before applicable taxes and fees” to households that meet the low-income eligibility guidelines used by the FCC’s Lifeline program. People who don’t qualify for low-income plans would presumably pay regular Starlink rates.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;The BEAD law requires ISPs receiving federal funds to offer at least one “low-cost broadband service option for eligible subscribers.” While the Biden administration sought low-income plans that cost &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/isps-seeking-government-handouts-try-to-avoid-offering-low-cost-broadband/"&gt;as little as $30 a month&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration decided that states &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/trump-admin-warns-states-dont-try-to-lower-broadband-prices/"&gt;may not tell ISPs&lt;/a&gt; what prices to charge in their low-cost options. A Trump administration threat to shut states out of BEAD if they required low prices &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/california-backs-down-to-trump-admin-wont-force-isps-to-offer-15-broadband/"&gt;doomed a California proposal&lt;/a&gt; to mandate $15 monthly plans for people with low incomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX told state governments that it should receive 50 percent of grant funds when it certifies that it is capable of providing BEAD-quality service (100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload speeds) within 10 business days to any potential customer that requests it in a grant area. The rest of the money would be distributed quarterly over the 10-year period of the grant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Explaining why SpaceX shouldn’t be penalized if potential customers decide Starlink prices are too high, the firm wrote:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tying payments to the independent purchasing decisions of users solely for awardees using LEO technologies, and not for any other technology, is, by definition, not technology neutral. SpaceX is already appropriately incentivized to gather customers by the opportunity to capture the monthly recurring revenue from each subscriber. SpaceX was in most instances awarded the most remote and difficult areas to serve among all other providers. SpaceX is up to the task of ensuring success in these challenging areas, however, it cannot undertake this mission without certainty of consistent payments to compensate such work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on SpaceX’s letter, it sounds like the work the company must do to ensure quality of service at BEAD-funded locations is the same work it has already done to make Starlink available across the US. Instead of dedicated capacity for government-subsidized deployments, SpaceX said it will simply factor the needs of BEAD users into its planning:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to capacity reservations, we have found some confusion regarding how such a reservation is made. Given the dynamic nature of the Starlink network, the reservation will not be such that SpaceX holds large portions of capacity fallow. This would be wasteful, inefficient, and does not reflect a LEO providers [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] ability to dynamically allocate capacity where needed. Instead, SpaceX will include the capacity needs of BEAD users into its network planning efforts. These activities are multifaceted and include real time capacity allocation at the network level, launch activities, and sales efforts. As a result, there is no single “document” evidencing the reservation of capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SpaceX wants limits on performance testing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX said it will be obvious if it does not provide sufficient service, and thus the states should not seek additional performance testing beyond what’s included in the NTIA guidelines. “If sufficient capacity was not reserved, performance testing will reveal insufficient quality of service, and this deficiency will be transparent to the state. Developing a separate, indirect measurement of the reservation itself is infeasible and unnecessary,” SpaceX said.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;The proposed rider said that any network testing must “exclude subscribers who have installed CPE [consumer premise equipment] such that its view of the sky is obstructed and subscribers with damaged or malfunctioning CPE, as determined by GRANTEE.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “as determined by GRANTEE” phrase means it’s up to SpaceX to decide which subscribers should be excluded from testing. As the Benton Society says, the rider stipulates that “performance tests can only be considered if the LEO provider determines that the subscriber’s equipment is properly installed, and, notably, the LEO provider is not obligated to ensure proper installation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s proposed rider defines a “standard installation” as the mailing of equipment to a subscriber. That’s the standard process for unsubsidized areas throughout the country, and SpaceX doesn’t want to do any extra work to help set up equipment for customers in subsidized areas. However, customers may be able to purchase professional installation for an extra fee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For the avoidance of doubt, the GRANTEE will not be responsible for completing a permanent installation” at each location, SpaceX’s proposed rider says. A satellite provider “may choose to offer the subscriber professional services for permanent installation of CPE at an additional fee, but such professional services shall not be considered part of the standard installation,” it says.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

City of Norfolk&lt;/i&gt;, was &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/lawsuit-city-cameras-make-it-impossible-to-drive-anywhere-without-being-tracked/"&gt;originally filed in October 2024&lt;/a&gt; by two Virginians who claimed that their rights were violated when the Flock network of cameras captured their cars hundreds of times, calling the entire setup a “dragnet surveillance program.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, in a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26511850-order-1-27-26/"&gt;51-page ruling&lt;/a&gt;, US District Court Judge Mark S. Davis disagreed, finding that the “…plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that Defendants’ ALPR system is capable of tracking the whole of a person’s movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Judge Davis acknowledged that while there may come a time when the use of ALPRs becomes too intrusive, “what is readily apparent to this Court is that, at least in Norfolk, Virginia, the answer is: not today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Virginia plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the Institute of Justice, a libertarian nonprofit public interest law firm &lt;a href="https://ij.org/press-release/hampton-roads-residents-will-appeal-court-decision-upholding-norfolks-license-plate-reader-surveillance/"&gt;that vowed to appeal the ruling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, Flock Safety has grown to become the most sophisticated and largest ALPR vendor in America. The City of Norfolk—along with thousands of other law enforcement agencies across the country—contracts with the Atlanta-based startup, most recently &lt;a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/flock-safety-secures-major-funding"&gt;valued at $7.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;, for ALPR services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flock cameras capture not just a simple license plate number—as the tech once did a decade ago—but now can easily capture make, model, and other visual details from each car; these can be searched using &lt;a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/products/flock-freeform"&gt;AI-powered natural language queries&lt;/a&gt; that can include phrases like “bike rack” or “tow truck.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recently, some jurisdictions, from &lt;a href="https://santacruzlocal.org/2026/01/13/santa-cruz-leaders-vote-to-terminate-contract-with-flock/"&gt;Santa Cruz, California,&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2026/01/charlottesville-ends-use-of-flock-surveillance-cameras-after-privacy-concerns"&gt;Charlottesville, Virginia,&lt;/a&gt; have ended their contracts with Flock over concerns that the technology is too invasive and may provide information to federal immigration authorities over the objections of local policymakers. Last year, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/flock-haters-cross-political-divides-to-remove-error-prone-cameras/"&gt;two senators expressed grave privacy concerns and wrote in a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the company that “abuse of Flock cameras is inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;In his Thursday ruling, Judge Davis referenced the family tree of modern surveillance case-law, noting that a 1983 Supreme Court case (&lt;a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1982/81-1802"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Knotts v. United States&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) found that there is no “reasonable expectation of privacy” when traveling on a public road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That 1983 case, which centered on a radio transmitter that enabled law enforcement to follow the movements of alleged drug traffickers driving between Minnesota and Wisconsin, has provided the legal underpinning for the use of ALPR technology in the United States over the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Modern-day license plate reader systems, like Norfolk’s, are nothing like [the technology of the early 1980s],” Michael Soyfer, one of the Institute of Justice attorneys, told Ars by email. “They track the movements of virtually every driver within a city for weeks at a time. That can reveal a host of insights not captured in any single trip.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For its part, Flock Safety celebrated the ruling and wrote &lt;a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/federal-court-confirms-license-plate-readers-are-constitutional?utm_campaign=2026-q1-ga-ga-ah-norfolk&amp;amp;utm_content=image&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; that its clients may continue to use the cameras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here, the court emphasized that LPR technology, as deployed in Norfolk, is meaningfully different from systems that enable persistent, comprehensive tracking of individuals’ movements,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When used with appropriate limitations and safeguards, LPRs do not provide an intimate portrait of a person’s life and therefore do not trigger the constitutional concerns raised by continuous surveillance,” it added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But some legal scholars disagree with both the judge’s and Flock’s conclusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.law.gwu.edu/andrew-guthrie-ferguson"&gt;Andrew Ferguson&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at George Washington University and the author of the forthcoming book &lt;a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479838295/your-data-will-be-used-against-you/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your Data Will Be Used Against You: Policing in the Age of Self-Surveillance&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told Ars by email that the judge’s ruling here is “understandably conservative and dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The danger is that the same reasoning that there is no expectation of privacy in public would justify having ALPR cameras on every single street corner,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Further,” he said, “looking at the technology as a mere tool, rather than a system of surveillance, misses the mark on its erosion of privacy. Think how revealing ALPRs would be outside religious institutions, gun ranges, medical clinics, addiction treatment centers, or protests.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         Congress recently grilled the acting chief on mass layoffs and a failed polygraph.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2202418998-1152x648.jpg" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="" loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2202418998-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2202418998-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2202418998-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2202418998-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                        &lt;a class="caption-credit-link text-gray-400 no-underline hover:text-gray-500" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/united-states-of-american-flag-and-robot-and-toy-on-royalty-free-image/2202418998?phrase=robot%20us%20flag&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"               target="_blank"&gt;                      Pakin Songmor | Moment                        &lt;/a&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="" name="page-1" data-page="1" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-cyber-defense-chief-accidentally-uploaded-secret-government-info-to-chatgpt/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alarming critics, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Madhu Gottumukkala, accidentally uploaded sensitive information to a public version of ChatGPT last summer, Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/27/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-chatgpt-00749361"&gt;reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to “four Department of Homeland Security officials with knowledge of the incident,” Gottumukkala’s uploads of sensitive CISA contracting documents triggered multiple internal cybersecurity warnings designed to “stop the theft or unintentional disclosure of government material from federal networks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gottumukkala’s uploads happened soon after he joined the agency and sought special permission to use OpenAI’s popular chatbot, which most DHS staffers are blocked from accessing, DHS confirmed to Ars. Instead, DHS staffers use approved AI-powered tools, like the agency’s DHSChat, which “are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks,” Politico reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It remains unclear why Gottumukkala needed to use ChatGPT. One official told Politico that, to staffers, it seemed like Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The information Gottumukkala reportedly leaked was not confidential but marked “for official use only.” That designation, a DHS &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Management%20Directive%2011042.1%20Safeguarding%20Sensitive%20But%20Unclassified%20%28For%20Official%20Use%20Only%29%20Information_0.pdf"&gt;document&lt;/a&gt; explained, is “used within DHS to identify unclassified information of a sensitive nature” that, if shared without authorization, “could adversely impact a person’s privacy or welfare” or impede how federal and other programs “essential to the national interest” operate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s now a concern that the sensitive information could be used to answer prompts from any of ChatGPT’s 700 million active users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OpenAI did not respond to Ars’ request to comment, but Cyber News &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/madhu-gottumukkala-cisa-chatgpt/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that experts have warned “that using public AI tools poses real risks because uploaded data can be retained, breached, or used to inform responses to other users.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sources told Politico that DHS investigated the incident for potentially harming government security—which could result in administrative or disciplinary actions, DHS officials told Politico. Possible consequences could range from a formal warning or mandatory retraining to “suspension or revocation of a security clearance,” officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;However, CISA’s director of public affairs, Marci McCarthy, declined Ars’ request to confirm if that probe, launched in August, has concluded or remains ongoing. Instead, she seemed to emphasize that Gottumukkala’s access to ChatGPT was only temporary, while suggesting that the ChatGPT use aligned with Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; to deploy AI across government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Acting Director Dr. Madhu Gottumukkala was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” McCarthy said. “This use was short-term and limited. CISA is unwavering in its commitment to harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver” on Trump’s order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Scrutiny of cyber defense chief remains&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gottumukkala has not had a smooth run as acting director of the top US cyber defense agency after Trump’s pick to helm the agency, Sean Plankey, was blocked by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) “over a Coast Guard shipbuilding contract,” Politico noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DHS Secretary Kristi Noem chose Gottumukkala to fill in after he previously served as her chief information officer, overseeing statewide cybersecurity initiatives in South Dakota. CISA celebrated his appointment with a &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-welcomes-madhu-gottumukkala-new-deputy-director"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; boasting that he had more than 24 years of experience in information technology and a “deep understanding of both the complexities and practical realities of infrastructure security.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, critics “on both sides of the aisle” have questioned whether Gottumukkala knows what he’s doing at CISA, Cyberscoop &lt;a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-madhu-gottumukkala-house-homeland-hearing-workforce-staffing-levels/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. That includes staffers who stayed on and staffers who prematurely left the agency due to uncertainty over its future, Politico reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least 65 staffers have been curiously reassigned to other parts of DHS, Cyberscoop reported, inciting Democrats’ fears that CISA staffers are possibly being pushed over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same fate almost befell Robert Costello, CISA’s chief information officer, who was reportedly involved with meetings last August probing Gottumukkala’s improper ChatGPT use and “the proper handling of for official use only material,” Politico reported.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, staffers alleged that Gottumukkala took steps to remove Costello from his CIO position, which he has held for the past four years. But that plan was blocked after “other political appointees at the department objected,” Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/18/acting-cisa-chief-sought-ouster-of-agencys-chief-information-officer-00735826"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Until others intervened to permanently thwart the reassignment, Costello was supposedly given “roughly one week” to decide if he would take another position within DHS or resign, sources told Politico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gottumukkala has denied that he sought to reassign Costello over a personal spat that Politico’s sources said sprang from “friction because Costello frequently pushed back against Gottumukkala on policy matters.” He insisted that “senior personnel decisions are made at the highest levels at the Department of Homeland Security’s Headquarters and are not made in a vacuum, independently by one individual, or on a whim.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reported move looked particularly shady, though, because Costello “is seen as one of the agency’s top remaining technical talents,” Politico reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/us-cyber-defense-chief-accidentally-uploaded-secret-government-info-to-chatgpt/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Congress questioned ongoing cybersecurity threats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This month, &lt;a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2026/01/lawmakers-press-acting-cisa-director-on-workforce-reductions/"&gt;Congress grilled Gottumukkala&lt;/a&gt; about mass layoffs last year that shrank CISA from about 3,400 staffers to 2,400. The steep cuts seemed to threaten national security and election integrity, lawmakers warned, and potentially have left the agency unprepared for any potential conflicts with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a hearing held by the House Homeland Security Committee, Gottumukkala said that CISA was “getting back on mission” and plans to reverse much of the damage done last year to the agency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some of his responses did not inspire confidence, including a failure to forecast “how many cyber intrusions CISA expects from foreign adversaries as part of the 2026 midterm elections,” the Federal News Network &lt;a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2026/01/lawmakers-press-acting-cisa-director-on-workforce-reductions/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) criticized Gottumukkala for not having “a specific number in mind.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, we should have that number,” Gonzales said. “It should first start by how many intrusions that we had last midterm and the midterm before that. I don’t want to wait. I don’t want us waiting until after the fact to be able to go, ‘Yeah, we got it wrong, and it turns out our adversaries influenced our election to that point.’”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Perhaps notably, Gottumukkala also dodged questions about reports that he &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/21/cisa-acting-director-madhu-gottumukkala-polygraph-investigation-00701996"&gt;failed a polygraph&lt;/a&gt; when attempting to seek access to other “highly sensitive cyber intelligence,” Politico reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The acting director apparently blamed six career CISA staffers for requesting that he agree to the polygraph test, which the staffers said was typical protocol but Gottumukkala later claimed was misleading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Failing the test isn’t necessarily damning, since anxiety or technical errors could trigger a negative result. However, Gottumukkala appears touchy about the test that he now regrets sitting for, calling the test “unsanctioned” and refusing to discuss the results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It seems that Gottumukkala felt misled after learning that he could have requested a waiver to skip the polygraph. In a letter suspending those staffers’ security clearances, CISA accused staff of showing “deliberate or negligent failure to follow policies that protect government information.” However, staffers may not have known that he had that option, which is considered a “highly unusual loophole that may not have been readily apparent to career staff,” Politico noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staffers told Politico that Gottumukkala’s tenure has been a “nightmare"—potentially ruining the careers of longtime CISA staffers. It troubles some that it seems that Gottumukkala will remain in his post “for the foreseeable future,” while seeming to politicize the agency and bungle protocols for accessing sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/12/cisa-tells-staff-not-speak-reporters-internal-email-shows/409884/"&gt;According to Nextgov,&lt;/a&gt; Gottumukkala plans to right the ship with “a hiring spree in 2026 because its recent reductions have hampered some of the Trump administration’s national security goals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November, the trade publication Cybersecurity Dive &lt;a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/cisa-hiring-workforce-strategy/805733/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Gottumukkala sent a memo confirming the hiring spree was coming that month, while warning that CISA remains “hampered by an approximately 40 percent vacancy rate across key mission areas.” All those cuts were “spurred by the administration’s animus toward CISA over its election security work,” Cybersecurity Dive noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“CISA must immediately accelerate recruitment, workforce development, and retention initiatives to ensure mission readiness and operational continuity,” Gottumukkala told staffers at that time, then later went on to reassure Congress this month that the agency has “the required staff” to protect election integrity and national security, Cyberscoop reported.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Last week, though, the &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; community woke up to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPx5SJHFvGM"&gt;a new video&lt;/a&gt; showing the game at least partially loading on what appears to be a simulated background server.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The people behind that video—and the &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; revival project that made it possible—told Ars they were optimistic about their efforts to coerce EA’s temperamental Frostbite engine into running the game without access to EA’s servers. That said, the team also wants to temper expectations that may have risen a bit too high in the wake of what is just a proof-of-concept video.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TPx5SJHFvGM?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TPx5SJHFvGM?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Andersson799’s early proof-of-concept video showing &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; partially loading on emulated local servers.            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People are getting excited [about the video], and naturally people are going to get their hopes up,” project administrator Laurie told Ars. “I don’t want to be the person that’s going to have to deal with the aftermath if it turns out that we can’t actually get anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Keep an eye on those packets&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; revival effort currently centers around &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfqe29/the_forts_forge/"&gt;The Fort’s Forge&lt;/a&gt;, a Discord server where a handful of volunteer engineers and developers have gathered to pick apart the game and its unique architecture. Laurie said they initially set up the group “out of little more than spite for EA and Bioware around the time the shutdown got announced” back in July.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Laurie has some experience with the community behind &lt;a href="https://1379.tech/the-making-of-side-7-gundam-evolution-private-server-project/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gundam Evolution&lt;/em&gt; revival project Side 7&lt;/a&gt;, they knew they’d need help from people with direct experience working on EA’s Frostbite engine games. Luckily, Laurie said they were “able to catch the eyes of people who are familiar with this line of work [without] searching too much.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of those people was Ness199X, an experienced Frostbite tinkerer who told Ars he “never really played much &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;” before the game’s shutdown was announced. When a friend pointed out the impending death of the title, though, Ness said he was motivated to preserve the game for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;Initial efforts to examine what made &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; tick “came up empty,” Ness said, largely because the game uses EA’s bespoke Frostbite engine differently than other EA titles. To begin mapping out those differences, Ness released a packet logger tool in September that let contributors record their own network traffic between the client and EA’s official servers. In addition to helping with reverse-engineering work, Ness writes on the Fort’s Forge Discord that players who logged their packets should be able to fully recover their characters if and when &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; comes back in playable form.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Catching Frostbite&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By analyzing that crowdsourced packet data, Ness said the Fort’s Forge team has been able to break &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; down into three essential services:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;EA’s Blaze server: Used for basic player authentication.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bioware Online Services (aka BIGS): A JSON web server used to track player information like inventory and quest progression.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Frostbite multiplayer engine: Loads level data and tracks the real-time positions of players and non-player characters in those levels.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early efforts to emulate the Blaze and BIGS portions of that architecture helped lead directly to last week’s proof-of-concept video. Andersson799—who says he’s been tinkering with &lt;em&gt;Battlefield&lt;/em&gt; and other Frostbite games since 2015—said he was quickly able to use his own logged &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; packets to create a “barebones anthem private server” that served as a “quick and dirty” sample that he decided to share via YouTube.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I basically made the tool to just simply reply with the packet captures that I got,” Andersson told me. That was enough to “get in to the game with player profiles loaded and everything.” And while Ness says there’s still some effort needed “to [make Blaze and BIGS] work well and smoothly in terms of quest progression, etc.,” the path forward on those portions is relatively straightforward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the Frostbite engine and its odd client-server architecture that forms the biggest barrier to getting &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; up and running again without EA’s servers. “Due to how Frostbite is designed, all gameplay in a Frostbite game runs in a ‘server’ context,” Ness explained. Even in a single-player game like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Andromeda&lt;/em&gt;, he said, “the client just creates a separate server thread and pipes all the traffic internally.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;“I feel like with &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;, it heavily relies on online data that was stored in Bioware’s server,” Andersson added. “In my initial testing, the game couldn’t load into the level without that data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="ars-video"&gt;&lt;div class="relative"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLsHdqHR0-E?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLsHdqHR0-E?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;‘s Fort Tarsis area loads its data from local files, rather than EA’s servers.            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s some hope that this crucial level data is still available and recoverable, though. Ness points out that Fort Tarsis, the game’s lobby area, already runs using offline data piped through a local “server” thread, meaning the rest of the game could theoretically be coerced to run similarly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as important, he says, “as far as we have been able to discern, all the logic for the other levels, which when the game was live ran on a remote server, also exists in the client,” Ness said. “By patching the game we can most likely enable the ability to host these in process as well. That’s what we’re exploring.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/01/why-reviving-the-shuttered-anthem-is-turning-out-tougher-than-expected/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;h2&gt;“To be honest we’re not entirely sure…”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While all that local level data should be usable in theory, seemingly random differences between &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; and other Frostbite games are getting in the way of loading the data in practice. &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; acts like a standard Frostbite game “for the most part,” Ness said, but at times will show unusual behaviors that are hard to pin down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For example, when we try to load most maps, no NPCs spawn, but in some maps they do,” he said. “And we have yet to determine why. Ness has some suspicion that the odd behavior is connected to the “fairly extensive amount of player data the game keeps as part of its online RPG nature,” but adds that “to be honest we’re not entirely sure how deep the differences go, other than that the engine didn’t behave how we expected it to.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ness said he’s about 75 percent confident that the team will be able to figure out how to fully leverage the Frostbite engine to power a version of the game that runs without EA’s centralized servers. If that effort succeeds, he says a playable version of &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt; could be back up and running in “months, or less even, depending on motivation.” But if the efforts to pick apart &lt;em&gt;Anthem&lt;/em&gt;’s take on Frostbite hits a brick wall, Ness says “the amount of work increases fairly exponentially and I’m a lot less confident that we have the motivation for that.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;“I’m fairly confident that we can get this game to be playable again, like how it is supposed to be,” Andersson said. “It’ll just take time as most of us have our own life to manage besides this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="505" height="391" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/laurie.png" class="fullwidth full" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               Engaging in some expectations management on the Fort’s Forge Discord.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       &lt;a href="https://discord.com/channels/1392103031205658747/1418279802552586412/1462849496500404402" target="_blank"&gt;Laurie / The Fort’s Forge&lt;/a&gt;                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Laurie is still trying to manage expectations set by the somewhat premature posting of Andersson’s proof-of-concept video. “Please, do not expect frequent updates,” Laurie wrote in the Fort’s Forge Discord. “We had not anticipated releasing anything this early, nor should the expedience of this video’s release serve as any kind of benchmark for how fast we make progress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laurie also &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1qfng76/comment/o06gfou/?context=3"&gt;took to Reddit&lt;/a&gt; to publicly call the video “a really hacky thing so I want to ask people to manage their expectations just a bit. A lot of stuff clearly doesn’t work as ‘intended,’ and definitely needs at minimum, more polish.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At one point last week, Laurie says they had to stop accepting new members to the Fort’s Forge Discord, “mostly to prevent an influx of people in response to… news coverage.” And while people with Frostbite engine modding experience are encouraged to reach out, the small team is being cautious about growing too large, too fast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re a little reluctant to add developers right now as we have no real code base to work from,” Ness said, describing their current efforts as “scratch work” maintained in separate forms by multiple people. “But once we firm that up (hopefully in the next weeks), we will look to add more [coders].”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was not until later that their connection to the Challenger tragedy was learned.                &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                        &lt;a class="caption-credit-link text-gray-400 no-underline hover:text-gray-500" href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012826a-challenger-sts-51l-tragedy-40-years-remove-before-flight.html"               target="_blank"&gt;                      collectSPACE.com                        &lt;/a&gt;                   &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="" name="page-1" data-page="1" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/attached-to-tragedy-tracing-challenger-remove-before-flight-tags/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Forty years ago, a stack of bright red tags shared a physical connection with what would become NASA’s first space shuttle disaster. The small tags, however, were collected before the ill-fated launch of &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt;, as was instructed in bold “Remove Before Flight” lettering on the front of each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happened to the tags after that is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is an attempt to learn more about &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012826a-challenger-sts-51l-tragedy-40-years-remove-before-flight.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;where those “Remove Before Flight” tags went&lt;/a&gt; after they were detached from the space shuttle and before they arrived on my doorstep. If their history can be better documented, they can be provided to museums, educational centers, and astronautical archives for their preservation and display.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To begin, we go back 16 years to when they were offered for sale on eBay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;From handout to hold on&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advertisement on the auction website was titled “Space Shuttle Remove Before Flight Flags Lot of 18.” They were listed with an opening bid of $3.99. On January 12, 2010, I paid $5.50 as the winner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At that point, my interest in the 3-inch-wide by 12-inch-long (7.6 by 30.5 cm) tags was as handouts for kids and other attendees at future events. Whether it was at an astronaut autograph convention, a space memorabilia show, a classroom visit, or a conference talk, having “swag” was a great way to foster interest in space history. At first glance, these flags seemed to be a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I didn’t pay much attention when they first arrived. The eBay listing had promoted them only as generic examples of “KSC Form 4-226 (6/77)"—the ID the Kennedy Space Center assigned to the tags. There was no mention of their being used, let alone specifying an orbiter or specific flight. If I recall correctly, the seller said his intention had been to use them on his boat.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;p&gt;(Attempts to retrieve the original listing for this article were unsuccessful. As an eBay spokesperson said, “eBay does not retain transaction records or item details dating back over a decade, and therefore we do not have any information to share with you.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was about a year later when I first noticed the ink stamps at the bottom of each tag. They were marked “ET-26” followed by a number. For example, the first tag in the clipped-together stack was stamped “ET-26-000006.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="360" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-640x360.jpg" class="center medium" alt="Bright red tags can be seen attached to a large component of space shuttle hardware." decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-980x551.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826b-lg.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               The same type of “Remove Before Flight” tags that were attached to ET-26 for &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt;‘s ill-fated STS-51L mission can be seen on one of the first two external tanks before it was flown, as distinguished by the insulation having been painted white.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012826a-challenger-sts-51l-tragedy-40-years-remove-before-flight.html" target="_blank"&gt;NASA via collectSPACE.com&lt;/a&gt;                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“ET” refers to the External Tank. The &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-011324a-shuttle-endeavour-exhibit-external-tank-lift.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;largest components of the space shuttle stack&lt;/a&gt;, the burnt orange or brown tanks were numbered, so 26 had to be one of the earlier missions of the 30-year, 135-flight program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fact sheet prepared by Lockheed Martin provided the answer. The company operated at the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, where the external tanks were built before being barged to the Kennedy Space Center for launch. Part of the sheet listed each launch with its date and numbered external tank. As my finger traced down the page, it came to STS 61-B, 11/26/85, ET-22; STS 61-C, 1/12/86, ET-30; and then STS 51-L, 1/28/86… ET-26.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Removed but still connected&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, the tags had no role in the loss of &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt; or its crew, including commander Dick Scobee; pilot Mike Smith; mission specialists Ronald McNair, Judith Resnik, and Ellison Onizuka; payload specialist Gregory Jarvis; and &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-090224a-christa-mcauliffe-statue-new-hampshire-unveiling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Teacher-in-Space Christa McAuliffe&lt;/a&gt;. Although the structural failure of the external tank ultimately resulted in &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt; breaking apart, it was a compromised O-ring seal in one of the shuttle’s two solid rocket boosters that allowed hot gas to burn through, impinging the tank.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Further, although it’s still unknown when the tags and their associated ground support equipment (e.g., protective covers, caps) were removed, it was not within hours of the launch, and in many cases, it was completed well before the vehicle reached the pad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They were removed later in processing at different times but definitely all done before propellant loading,” said Mike Cianilli, the former manager of NASA’s &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-091525a-nasa-kennedy-columbia-learning-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apollo, Challenger, Columbia Lessons Learned Program&lt;/a&gt;. “To make sure they were gone, final walkdowns and closeouts by the ground crews confirmed removal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="page-anchor-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a class="record-pageview" name="page-2" data-page="2" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/01/attached-to-tragedy-tracing-challenger-remove-before-flight-tags/" href="https://arstechnica.com/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="959" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-640x959.jpg" class="center medium" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-640x959.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-1024x1535.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg-980x1469.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826c-lg.jpg 1281w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               Close-up view of the liftoff of the space shuttle Challenger on its ill-fated last mission, STS-51L. A cloud of grey-brown smoke can be seen on the right side of the solid rocket booster on a line directly across from the letter “U” in United States. This was the first visible sign that an SRB joint breach may have occurred, leading to the external tank (ET-26) being compromised during its ascent.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       NASA                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to NASA, approximately 20 percent of ET-26 was recovered from the ocean floor after the tragedy, and like the parts of the solid rocket boosters and &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt;, they were placed into storage in two retired missile silos at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (today, Space Force Station). Components removed from the vehicle before the ill-fated launch that were no longer needed likely went through the normal surplus processes as overseen by the General Services Administration, said Cianilli.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the tags’ association with STS-51L was confirmed, it no longer felt right to use them as giveaways. At least, not to individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are very few items directly connected to &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt;‘s last flight that museums and other public centers can use to connect their visitors to what transpired 40 years ago. NASA has placed only one &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-062715d-challenger-columbia-nasa-exhibit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;piece of &lt;em&gt;Challenger&lt;/em&gt; on public display&lt;/a&gt;, and that is in the exhibition “Forever Remembered” at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each of the 50 US states, the Smithsonian, and the &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012822a-shuttle-challenger-reagan-artifacts-recovered.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;president of the United States&lt;/a&gt; were also presented with a small &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012816b-challenger-flags-patches-30years.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American flag and a mission patch&lt;/a&gt; that had been aboard&lt;em&gt; Challenger&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Having a more complete history of these tags would help meet the accession requirements of some museums and, if approved, provide curators with the information they need to put the tags on display.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reconnecting to flight&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the tags were first identified, contacts at NASA and Lockheed, among others, were unable to explain how they ended up on eBay and, ultimately, with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was 2011, and the space shuttle program was coming to its end. I was politely told that this was not the time to ask about the tags, as documents were being moved into archives and, perhaps more importantly, people were more concerned about pending layoffs. One person suggested the tags be put back in a drawer and forgotten about for another decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the years since, other “Remove Before Flight” tags from other space shuttle missions have come up for sale. Some have included evidence that the tags had passed through the surplus procedures; some did not and were offered as is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="ars-lightbox"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="360" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-640x360.jpg" class="center medium" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-640x360.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-384x216.jpg 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-1152x648.jpg 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-980x551.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/news-012826e-lg.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;               Close-up detail of two of the 18 shuttle “Return Before Flight” tags purchased off eBay. All were marked “ET-26” with a serial number. Some included additional stamps and handwritten notations. Most of the latter, though, has bled into the fabric to the point that it can no longer be read.                               &lt;div class="ars-gallery-caption-credit"&gt;Credit:                    Credit:                                       &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012826a-challenger-sts-51l-tragedy-40-years-remove-before-flight.html" target="_blank"&gt;collectSPACE.com&lt;/a&gt;                                   &lt;/div&gt;                           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;p&gt;There were anecdotes about outgoing employees taking home mementos. Maybe someone saw these tags heading out as scrap (or worse, being tossed in the garbage) and, recognizing what they were, saved them from being lost to history. An agent with the NASA Office of Inspector General once said that dumpster diving was not prohibited, so long as the item(s) being dived for were not metal (due to recycling).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More recent attempts to reach people who might know anything about the specific tags have been unsuccessful, other than the few details Cianilli was able to share. An attempt to recontact the eBay seller has so far gone unanswered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know worked on the external tank at the time of the STS-51L tragedy, or if you’re familiar with NASA’s practices regarding installing, retrieving, and archiving or disposing of the Remove Before Flight tags, please &lt;a href="https://www.collectspace.com/about.html#contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;get in contact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;         The Auto Browse agent is available to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, but there are some limits.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="1152" height="648" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-1152x648.png" class="intro-image absolute min-w-full min-h-full h-auto object-cover" alt="Chrome icon in roller coaster" loading="eager" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-1152x648.png 1152w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-640x360.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-768x432.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-384x216.png 384w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-980x551.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1-1440x810.png 1440w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chrome_rollercoaster-1.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;                       &lt;span class="caption-credit mt-2 text-xs"&gt;           Credit:                       Google                    &lt;/span&gt;           &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                         &lt;p&gt;Google began stuffing Gemini into its dominant Chrome browser several months ago, and today the AI is expanding its capabilities considerably. Google says the chatbot will be easier to access and connect to more Google services, but the biggest change is the addition of Google’s autonomous browsing agent, which it has dubbed Auto Browse. Similar to tools like &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2025/10/we-let-openais-agent-mode-surf-the-web-for-us-heres-what-happened/"&gt;OpenAI Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, Auto Browse can handle tedious tasks in Chrome so you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newly unveiled Gemini features in Chrome are accessible from the omnipresent AI button that has been lurking at the top of the window for the last few months. Initially, that button only opened Gemini in a pop-up window, but Google now says it will default to a split-screen or “Sidepanel” view. Google confirmed the update began rolling out over the past week, so you may already have it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can still pop Gemini out into a floating window, but the split-view gives Gemini more room to breathe while manipulating a page with AI. This is also helpful when calling other apps in the Chrome implementation of Gemini. The chatbot can now access Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Google Shopping, and Google Flights right from the Chrome window. Google technically added this feature around the middle of January, but it’s only talking about it now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;   &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;     &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2137804-1" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Animation_Gmail-integration-1.mp4?_=1"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;Sidepanel with Gmail integration&lt;/video&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Sidepanel with Gmail integration            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Gemini in Chrome can now also access and edit images with Nano Banana, so you don’t have to download and re-upload them to Gemini in another location. Just open the image from the web and type in the Sidepanel with a description of the edits you want. Like in the Gemini app, you can choose between the slower but higher-quality Pro model and the faster standard one.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                             &lt;h2&gt;Can’t someone else do it?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chrome’s new browsing agent (in preview) is the star of today’s show. The promise of agentic AI is one of the freedom to be lazy. Rather than filling out forms or copying information from emails, you simply task a robot with the job and relax while it goes to work. At least, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Most of the computer-use agents we’ve seen so far have been sluggish and unreliable enough to require human supervision. That kind of defeats the purpose. Now it’s Google’s turn to show us what its browsing agent can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google says Auto Browse is based on its latest &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/11/google-unveils-gemini-3-ai-model-and-ai-first-ide-called-antigravity/"&gt;Gemini 3 models&lt;/a&gt;, with input from the company’s work on the experimental Project Mariner agent. If you’d do something with a keyboard and mouse inside your browser, Auto Browse is theoretically able to take over. It can also access the content and tabs in your browser, asking for permission when it needs sensitive data, such as your passwords.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;   &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;     &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2137804-2" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Animation_apartment-hunting-with-Redfin-1-opt.mp4?_=2"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;Apartment hunting with Auto Browse&lt;/video&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Apartment hunting with Auto Browse            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;When you launch an Auto Browse task, Chrome will open new tabs as necessary and mark them with a sparkly AI icon so you know where the robot is active. You don’t have to keep that tab in the foreground, and you can even have multiple AI tasks going at once. The AI will ping you to check in when the task is done or when it needs your input. However, there are limits on Auto Browse similar to some of the company’s more computationally intensive chatbot functions. AI Pro subscribers get 20 AI browsing tasks per day, but those paying for AI Ultra get 200 per day.&lt;/p&gt;                                                      &lt;p&gt;Having the AI churning in the background may be a concern—after all, generative AI can make mistakes, and you are giving it complete control over the browsing experience. Google says it has implemented a range of security and safety rules to prevent misuse. For example, if you ask Auto Browse to research and buy something, it won’t actually buy it. Instead, it will find the item (hopefully) and progress to the purchase screen before letting you pull the trigger manually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="video ars-wp-video"&gt;   &lt;div class="wrapper ars-wp-video-wrapper relative"&gt;     &lt;video class="wp-video-shortcode absolute w-full h-full object-cover left-0 top-0" id="video-2137804-3" width="1920" height="1080" preload="metadata" controls="controls"&gt;&lt;source type="video/mp4" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Animation_filling-form-from-PDF-1-opt.mp4?_=3"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;Filling a form with Auto Browse&lt;/video&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;figcaption&gt;     &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;div class="caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300"&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="caption-content"&gt;       Filling a form with Auto Browse            &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind is that Auto Browse doesn’t run locally. All content from your robotically operated tab is streamed to a cloud-based Gemini model. That means page content will be shared with Google, but the extent is not entirely clear. Google says Auto Browse is governed by the established &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en#chrome_data&amp;amp;zippy=%2Cwhat-happens-to-my-data-when-i-use-gemini-in-chrome"&gt;Gemini in Chrome policy&lt;/a&gt;, which says Google stores information from websites in the Gemini Apps Activity (if Keep Activity is enabled). Page content is also “logged to your Google Account temporarily.” We asked if Google would use page contents processed by Auto Browse to further train AI models, but a spokesperson declined to provide specifics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chrome Auto Browse is rolling out today in preview, but it’s not exactly free. It won’t cost anything extra, but the feature is limited to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers. Google’s language suggests the feature may come to free users after the preview phase, but we’d expect strict usage limits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
