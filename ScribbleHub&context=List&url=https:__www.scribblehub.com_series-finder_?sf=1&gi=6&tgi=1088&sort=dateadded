      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long ago, a war fought with demons conjured from hell nearly destroyed Tedor. In a surprising display of sense, every surviving kingdom agreed that demon-summoning was too dangerous. They sealed away the tomes and executed the summoners, and that particular sorcery was lost to time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly they didn't do a good enough job. Agnes Sloane, a 38-year old demon computer programmer, has been conjured from the region of Hell known as Seattle and forced to do the bidding of an ambitious duchess of Siteria. Desperately, Agnes clings to the hope that she someday might find a way to return to her wife and daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wouldn't hold my breath, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2128980-no-no-no-i-got-summoned-to-another-world-as-a-demon-and-now-i-have-to-follow-each-and-every-one-of-mistresss-orders/chapter/2146197/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Action Cat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I observed the distant fortress, planning my assault. As usual, I'd been given a very specific to-do list, a set of rules to precisely control my behavior, and no intel of any kind, so this kind of surveillance was important. Probably wouldn't be able to intuit where the dungeon was by which windows were lit, though. As I considered angles of approach, I reached up and fidgeted with my collar, sliding a finger under it and twisting the smooth band around my neck, like I used to do with my wedding ring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A stealthy approach would be best. Not because Mistress had ordered me to. Actually, the fact that she hadn't probably meant that whatever machinations she had spinning were relying on me making a ruckus. No; if I was stealthy then fewer people would try to stop me and I wouldn't have to do so much killing. That's why I was taking my time surveying the place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, I was about two miles away, laying down on a hill in the twilight, using a spell that bent the air into a lens to magnify my vision. It was new — I'd learned it recently to replace the expensive spyglass that I'd broken during my last mission — and it worked better than I thought it would, though it was finicky to cast. I'd spent the past day observing my target from different angles so that I could get a complete picture. No time limit on this mission, so I was allowed to be as slow as I wanted as long as I was steadily working toward a goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fort's external defenses were twofold: a broad moat and high stone walls. It was five sided, with small towers at each corner, a pretty typical configuration for a smallish Arvallan castle. I hadn't been able to get a clear view inside, but probably there were alarm bells or signal fires or something. Tonight there were only two guards patrolling the walls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The internal keep's defenses were presumably soldier-based, which I would have no troubles with. There might be other stuff, but that would be placed to defend the minor nobles who lived here, with whom I had no business whatsoever unless they took up arms to personally defend their home. Magical defenses were unlikely for such a low-ranking family, but were never completely out of the question, especially now that Arvall's diplomatic relationships with the beastkin of Daumeir looked to be improving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I used to read portal fantasy books, I would always get frustrated when the main character would totally gloss over all the worldbuilding stuff, but now I kind of get it. I can't provide a comprehensive look at the current geopolitical situation in Tedor right now, partially because I don't have a clear view of it myself and partially because I need to break into this fucking fortress, but here's a simple version. This is Arvall, fairly close to the Daumeir border. The kingdom that I'm from is Siteria, to the south. The continent that we're on is called Tedor. Okay, great, let's move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I said it was a moat, but I'd always pictured a moat as a fairly narrow strip of water around a castle. Really, it was more like there was an artificial lake that went right up to the castle's walls. I might be able to jump it, this body's strength meant that I could jump a ridiculously long distance, but the amount of momentum that I'd need would have me slamming into the wall like a cannonball. I could swim across, but I'd probably need to take off most of my gear. I might be ten times as strong as a normal person from this world, but I would still sink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After swimming across, I'd need to climb the walls. Getting climbing equipment past the moat would be tough, so the most efficient way would be to jam my clawed fingers into the mortar between the stones. That sort of thing took precision, so no enhanced speed. If I got noticed, the guards would have plenty of time to shoot arrows down at me. Or dump boiling oil on me, which wouldn't kill me but would hurt like hell. Even if they didn't notice, I'd still be clinging to the side of a sheer wall soaking wet while cold wind whipped around me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shivered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or I could just kick the door down. The fort was accessible by a long bridge just wide enough for a single cart. There were two guards stationed at the land end of the bridge, equipped with spears in addition to their standard swords and breastplates. There was also a bell to ring in case of an alarm. Some nights there were one or two more guards patrolling back and forth across the bridge but not tonight for some reason. I guess I was lucky. At the fortress end of the bridge was the gatehouse. There would be at least one more guard in there, along with the typical double-portcullis meant to trap invaders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried to convince myself that the only moral thing to do was to risk the moat. Except it wasn't not like this was an &lt;em&gt;assassination&lt;/em&gt;. It was a rescue, which meant that I'd need to lead an escort back out. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; wouldn't be able to climb down the wall and swim to shore with arrows flying after them. So I'd have to go out the front and face down the guards at the bridge anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my heart I was still a normal person, despite everything. I liked to think that I was, at least, that if I managed to make it back home my wife would still recognize me. I wasn't sure whether Mistress had chosen to let me retain my sense of morality or if she'd just been unable to change it, but even though I'd gotten somewhat desensitized to killing, I was still fucked up about getting blood on my hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I imagined myself as I once was, a chubby computer programmer with mousy brown hair from Washington, and couldn't help but laugh bitterly at the thought of that kind of person having a dramatic inner monologue about whether or not she'd gotten used to killing. The ridiculous nature of my situation still made me laugh. I should say, actually, that I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to laugh at it, because the moment that I stopped laughing I would start screaming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn't want to swim through the moat and climb the wall if there was a chance it would be for nothing. And I wasn't all that good at being sneaky anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe … maybe if they saw a demon approaching they would just run. If I told them how to get away from me safely. Certainly word should have spread of my exploits by now. They had to know that without specific precautions they wouldn't have any chance to even drive me off, let alone kill me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I waved my hand to dispel my magnifier and made my decision. I kept making it with every step I took down the far side of the hill. My stomach was roiling because probably most of my choice was motivated by valuing these people's lives less than my own comfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wave of need washed through me. I wish I could say it was for my wife's embrace, but really what I wanted was Mistress's hand on my head, telling me that I was good, telling me that it was all her fault and that I didn't need to feel guilty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the back of the hill, I hiked a mile cross-country through woodland to the main road. I'd been planning to just sprint the rest of the way, but by that point it was full dark and probably I would hit a tree, so I took my time. The trip took me about two hours in all. I can't imagine what someone would have thought if they'd come across me on the road, strolling along in the nearly pitch-black, humming The Black Parade to myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guards must have heard the crunch of my boots on the dirt before they saw me, because one raised her lantern and shouted, "Who goes there!? Show yourself!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My pulse started racing, my tail lashed, and my guts twisted as adrenaline hit me. Planning time was over. Acting time was go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I obliged by casting a light spell, which illuminated me in eerie red. I don't know if that was truly necessary, given the horns that curved from my forehead and my previously mentioned lashing tail. There was only one kind of creature with that combination of appendages, and until the last handful of years it had been relegated to myth and ancient history. I wasn't just aura farming for the fun of it, I was trying to keep them safe by scaring them off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Stop where you are!" the guard with the lantern shouted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill anyone who draws against you or otherwise stands in your way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn't. "Drop your weapons, run away, and I won't kill you," I shouted back. Hopefully they were smart enough to put two and two together and figure out that meant if they &lt;em&gt;drew&lt;/em&gt; their weapons that I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; kill them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Sound the alarm," ordered the guard who hadn't shouted. He lowered his spear to point at me. The other dropped her weapon and grabbed for the bell-rope. Hey, that's a good idea, maybe I could keep them from sounding the alarm. I grabbed a knife from my bandolier and flung it. It missed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a moment, I imagined how cool it would have been if that had cut the rope in half. Unfortunately, I didn't get accuracy along with my speed and strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The female guard still hadn't pointed a weapon at me. I had to kill the male guard one way or the other now, but maybe I could do it in a way that made it clear that she couldn't beat me? I flashstepped forward, closing the distance like a bullet, and reappeared with my sword impaling him, stabbed straight through his armor and also his lung. I'd intended to get his heart so that he'd suffer less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sorry, dude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He gasped. Blood drooled out of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"D-demon!" the remaining guard screamed as she fled toward the fortress. Right idea, wrong direction. I yanked the sword out of the man I'd killed, but even with super strength it was kind of stuck on the breastplate and bones and stuff, and it made a horrible grinding noise. I flinched as his blood spattered against my face and tossed him off the bridge and into the moat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other guard was running like I wanted, but not to get away; she was trying to warn the fort about the nature of the threat. A bell couldn't communicate that a &lt;em&gt;demon&lt;/em&gt; was attacking. I ran past her, then put myself between her and the fort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Run away," I growled. "Flee for your life." Please, get the hint. I could've killed you &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, and the only reason I didn't is because you haven't—&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She drew her sword and looked at me with idiot bravery shining through her fear. For &lt;em&gt;fuck's&lt;/em&gt; sake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frustration got the better of me and the woman didn't get a clean death. Sorry, lady. I hope they bury you and don't just toss you all in a bonfire. I forced myself to look at her while I whipped out a knife and added two notches to the edge of my sword.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sound of a chain clanking drew my attention just in time to see the gatehouse's portcullis falling shut. Too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too late for them, that is. I had multiple seconds to dash underneath it and into the gatehouse before it closed, which was plenty of time. It was a plain, narrow room lit by torches in the corners. There was a lot of yelling around me — four guards were surrounding me, but they hadn't gotten their swords out yet because my speed had surprised them — but as soon as I appeared inside, the &lt;em&gt;second &lt;/em&gt;portcullis started to drop; the one that would seal the gatehouse from the bailey. I had even more time to duck under it than I had the first, though, so I did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then I was attacked by five soldiers, one of whom managed to give me a minor cut on my arm. Dispatching them took a couple minutes. The four in the gatehouse were cut off from me for now and weren't so brain-dead as to pull a sword on me when we couldn't even touch each other, so I was able to ignore them for the moment. Someone would let them out once I was out of sight, probably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like that, I carved a bloody trail into the fortress, occasionally pausing to notch my sword. After the first deaths, I grew colder to the killing. Never completely numb, but not losing my temper like I had with the suicidally heroic second guard. I would cry later, in private, as I reviewed my notches. I kept track because I needed to know, needed to know the size of the stain I was bearing. I tried, once, to completely disconnect, to tell myself that I was simply a doll without will and therefore could not be blamed, but the guilt and shame hit me even harder when I stopped dissociating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whenever I could, I repeated my offer, though I don't think I managed as good a delivery as I had the first time. A few took me up on it. Most didn't. The worst part was the man who drew his sword, took a swing against me, and then fled. My orders were such that I needed to chase him down, which caused another fight and more deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It really wasn't the least bit fair. Someone from the real world outmatched anyone from here a dozen times over, no matter our actual physical ability. I was Mistress's tactical warhead, and she deployed me with absolute precision. I wasn't absolutely invincible — I sustained a few wounds in the process — but nothing that I even needed to stop and magically heal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm sure it terrified people,&lt;/em&gt; Mistress once told me, &lt;em&gt;the thought of someone like you roaming around with free will! Hence this delightful device was invented.&lt;/em&gt; She'd hooked a finger under my collar and used it to yank my head back and forth while I whined.&lt;em&gt; And even &lt;/em&gt;then&lt;em&gt; it was decided that your kind were too dangerous, and the knowledge of your summoning and control was sealed away!&lt;/em&gt; Sealed away until she'd unearthed it and used what she'd found to rip me from my home and set me to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took me longer than it should have to find the dungeons, because I was looking for a downward staircase, but of course if there had been a basement here it would be underwater. The dungeon was on the ground floor, in the back of the keep, close to the barracks. The wooden door splintered under my boot and I rushed inside, hoping to take anyone there by surprise. I was rewarded by a dumbfounded expression on the warden's face. By the look of him, there was a reason why he was &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; and not with a sword in his hand defending the place. In an instant, my blade was pressed to his throat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Drop your weapons. Run away. And you'll live," I told him, quietly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Okay." He held up his empty hands and nodded as vehemently as he could with a sword under his chin. "Okay."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Wait," I added. "Do you have a key for the cells?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Pocket," he said, reaching down for his pocket. I nodded. He stepped close to hand it to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, he stepped close to stab me in the kidney. I hadn't been paying close enough attention. Not a key, a knife. I gasped in pain. His eyes went wide and triumphant and he stabbed me again, but he didn't get to hear the noise I made because my sword went through his neck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Stupid," I muttered, though I wasn't sure if I was cursing myself or him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was leaking all over my clothes. Also, let me be clear, it hurt very badly. I'm tough as hell (literally) but that doesn't mean I don't feel pain. That wound probably would have killed a normal person, but for me it would heal eventually. I actually wasn't sure how long something like this would take because I always just used magic. I cast heal and shut the wounds, then notched my sword. Poor bastard really thought he'd gotten me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I knelt down to rifle through the warden's pockets, the prisoners clustered up to the bars, murmuring, but when they saw my horns and tail they all shied back into the shadows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free the prisoners and escort them out of the fortress. Typical bodyguard priorities&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(which meant that I should protect them from all harm, even if it meant harming myself, but I should let them die rather than let myself be killed)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hero time. As though I knew anything about that. Took a few deep breaths and forced some emotion back into my voice. I wasn't sure if I was putting on a mask or taking one off, but I needed to be something other than a reluctant killing machine for the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Relax," I announced. "I'm here to free you." My search didn't turn up any keys, and a glance around the room didn't reveal any, either. Maybe it was hidden or maybe I'd just failed to find it because the room was only lit by a flickering oil lamp, but it didn't matter that much. I notched my sword for the warden, then used his tunic to clean off the blood and sheathed it. This wasn't a high-security magical prison, so I didn't really even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a key. I walked right up to the rusty bars and grabbed hold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"All of us?" came a suspicious, masculine voice from inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked up and squinted, but there wasn't enough light to see clearly. Five or six people in the cell, I thought. "All of you."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A young man stepped forward a little, enough that I could see his wide, uncomprehending eyes. "Why?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I don't believe in carceral justice. I'm a bleeding heart liberal." I suppose I'm glad that all the shit I've done hasn't ruined my dumbass sense of humor. It helped that, as a chick with red skin, horns, and a tail, people kind of &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; me to say shit that they didn't understand. Mistress thought it was cute. I shifted my grip, then strained. It hurt, but it worked, and the bars slowly bent like clay. "Don't all rush out at once." I moved on to the next cell, which only had one person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Wait, don't, that's—" The boy's cry was cut off as the first speaker put a hand over his mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What he means to say, ma'am, is the one in that cell is a murderer. Killed five so far." I looked at him and his eyes darted to his feet, then he haltingly bowed his head. "Begging your pardon. It's your grace's choice, of course."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Don't," I said, cringing. "Don't call me that. I'm not nobility, I'm just a—" &lt;em&gt;A blue-collar Jane&lt;/em&gt; was the joke I wanted to make (although my collar was actually silver) but that's not what I said. "—slave." It felt gross to say that. But I couldn't help it, because it felt good, too. Right. A relief. A conditioned reaction, of course. That's how Mistress defined our relationship. "And I'm rescuing &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, regardless of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they're here."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Hot tip," I continued as I stepped back to start on the next set of bars, yammering automatically to try and shake off the fuzzy feelings that built up in my skull when I called myself that. "If you ever have the misfortune to encounter another demon, the traditional mode of address is Hellboy. Or Hellgirl, for a demoness."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"And that will … &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; them, … Hellgirl?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"They might think it's funny, yeah." If they have decent taste in comics, at least. Another heave and the bars were plenty wide for the woman in the cell. "If what he said is true," I addressed her as I wiped sweat off my forehead, "I want to warn you. Don't point a weapon at me or I'll kill you. Or at any of them." I tilted my head at the first cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Wouldn't dream of it," she said, evenly. She was plain-looking, with dirty red hair and the same prison garb as the rest of them, but she held herself with far more poise. She also had a pair of fox-like ears on the top of her head, with fur that matched her hair. Beastkin, probably from Daumeir if I had to guess. No wonder she was in a separate cell. I could tell by her face that she was trying to parse my accent and figure out where I was from. Fortunately, even speaking a language that had been magically delivered into my brain, my accent was firmly American and thus uniquely bizarre to the people from this world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wondered whether it was true about the murders, and what the circumstances were. A female murderer, especially from a minority group, was more likely to have killed to protect herself in my experience. Maybe I was biased. It was easy to imagine that she'd been assaulted, killed the rapist, was imprisoned, and had her crime exaggerated to the other prisoners. I decided to believe that, because it made me feel better about letting her out. Yippee, I'm one of the good guys!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"That goes for the rest of you, too. Don't get any ideas about shanking each other. Play nice and let me rescue you. Magic, too, obviously," I added for the benefit of the fox-girl. Not all beastkin were proficient with magic, but the ones who were outclassed human mages significantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Shank?" mumbled a woman's voice, and someone else shushed her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I walked back to the broken door. "Alright, new friends. Time to play duckling, now." They hobbled out of the cells and clustered behind me. One of them, slower than the rest, had a blindfold on and was being led by an older woman. "I'm guessing the blindfold isn't just fashionable?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"N-no, Hellgirl," the woman said, and I fought down a smirk at the name. Stupid. I can't believe I said that. "He's blind."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sighed. "Alright. Here, I'll lead him." I took his hand from her, then noticed that there was still someone else in the cell. I sighed again. "Come on," I said, starting to be annoyed. "Let's go."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Please, no, ma'am," the prisoner stammered. "I'll just get recaptured and punished."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Entirely plausible, but it didn't change anything. "Don't care," I said, "come &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She curled into a ball and shook her head. "For the love of &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt;," I groaned, then squeezed through the bars and into the cell. She started shaking as I got closer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill anyone who draws against you or otherwise stands in your way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was this standing in my way? Did I need to kill her? I touched the hilt of my sword, unhappy about the prospect. No; no, she was &lt;em&gt;impeding&lt;/em&gt; me certainly, by not following instructions, but I wouldn't say she was &lt;em&gt;standing in my way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to hurt you," I said, feeling relieved about the fact. "I'm just gonna—" I bent down, put my left arm around her waist, and hefted her over my shoulder into a fireman carry. She squeaked in alarm, but was smart enough not to struggle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe next time Mistress had me do this sort of rescue I'd suggest an exception. Like: &lt;em&gt;if any of the prisoners want to stay, you can let them&lt;/em&gt;. I spent a lot of time fantasizing how I could change my orders to make them more efficient, but she usually rejected my ideas. She thought it was amusing when my tasks were complicated by logic errors. There was some kind of sick irony that a programmer had been made into something like a living algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Left hand for the reluctant prisoner, right hand for my sword… "Here." I wrapped my tail around the blind guy's wrist. "Hold onto my tail, I guess. No yanking."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Yes, Hellgirl," he said, squeezing it slightly, his forehead wrinkling. It probably felt kind of weird to him, sort of like a friendly snake covered in skin. Having a stranger squeeze my tail felt kind of weird to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;, but I would have to cope. It was &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; going to get yanked at some point in the next hour and I needed to prepare myself psychologically for that fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Automatically, I reviewed my list of orders. It took me a couple minutes, and when I finished, a shiver of pleasure thrilled through me. Good. I was a good girl. Another conditioned reaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in the real world, my memory hadn't been all that great. That was the first thing that Mistress worked on, because if I &lt;em&gt;forgot&lt;/em&gt; an order, I could disobey it. The magic of the collar &lt;em&gt;enforced&lt;/em&gt; commands, but it relied on my own mind to recognize and interpret what those commands were. Before you ask, no, I can't do the trick of conveniently forgetting things that I don't like. That's one of my top five standing orders, so if I— I'm getting off track. The specifics of my orders and how the collar works aren't something I need to get into right now. Maybe next chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My entourage and I left the dungeon and I led them through the fortress. I tried to take a different route than the one that I'd come in with, to spare them the sight of the mess I'd made, but we still came across a few. They gasped and murmured among themselves, but I was splattered with blood all over so I'm not sure what they were expecting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was smooth sailing. I began to happily imagine that the surviving soldiers had realized that they had no hope of defeating me and also that I had no interest in going out of my way to kill anyone. I was just here to release the prisoners, not to assassinate whatever petty lord held court here. It would have been so nice if I could have just shown up, had a chat with whoever lived here, and worked out a way to accomplish my task without death, but nobody ever wanted to dicker with a demon. We had a reputation for being tricky and legalistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gosh, I wonder why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, when we were almost back to the main hall, the one where the lord of the fortress would have met with petitioners, we ran into a trap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a line of salt barring the doorway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may not pass above a line of salt. You may not disrupt such a line either, obviously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I blinked at it, mouth going dry. How could they know about that? If they knew that, then they might know the other ways I was restricted, and if they knew that, then—&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, no, they didn't know anything. It was for the same reason Mistress had given me that rule: because she thought it was funny. It was myth, and it amused her to sometimes force me to act in ways that corresponded with mythical depictions of demons. In this case, it was a convenient way for her to easily fuck with me, restrict my access to parts of my home, and make sure I didn't move her bookmark in anything she was reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At other points in time she'd prevented me from magically healing wounds caused by silver weapons, required that I act afraid of fire, and forced me to count any small objects spilled in front of me. I said, &lt;em&gt;no, that's werewolves, frankensteins, and vampires&lt;/em&gt; but she just laughed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staring at it, I tried to plot a route around it. If we backtracked … No, there would be a reason this was here. They didn't want me to take this route. There would be some other trap elsewhere, or maybe that way would be sealed by salt, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned to the prisoners and met the eyes of the fox-girl because she was the only one who didn't flinch at my gaze. I opened my mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may not ask someone else to help you circumvent a rule. This includes gestures, vague implications, significant glances, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I closed my mouth and looked back at the salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I probably could cross it, though my mind shied away from the thought. My collar couldn't actually control my mind or my body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No. No, I couldn't. I trembled, ashamed at my eagerness to justify disobedience. I was a good girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't what Mistress meant, though. If she'd thought that someone would have done this, then she would've removed the order. It was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or was it? It wasn't my place to question my orders. Perhaps Mistress had leaked this weakness as a way to test me. Or maybe it would better serve her for me to be seen to have these weaknesses, to convince her enemies that I could be easily diverted only to remove the weakness later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I took a running leap … momentum would carry me over. I'd need to somehow convince myself that I was running and jumping for some &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reason or else my collar would block it. Even if I successfully got over, my collar would automatically register that I had broken a rule and would punish me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shouldn't. Mistress wouldn't want that. I sighed as, after five rounds of back-and-forth in my head, I realized the truth. It was relaxing. It felt good to give in. For this mission, at least, Mistress didn't want me to be an infallible tactical warhead. She wanted me to be a creature of myth with weaknesses that could be exploited. She wanted me to have the potential for failure. If I circumvented those rules, her plans would be ruined, and I would be a very bad girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would need to think of another way out. I nodded to myself, then turned. "This route won't work," I announced. "We'll go out a window."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Why?" piped up the murderer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may not ask someone else to help you circumvent a rule. This includes gestures, vague implications, significant glances, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question put me in an awkward position. Telling her that I couldn't cross the salt was as good as asking her to help me circumvent it; to satisfy my own sense of Mistress's desires I had to make my best attempt to deflect. But my mind was free enough that I could still hope she was smart enough to see through it. "There's a trap ahead," I lied. "I can't risk your safety." I can tell because of the pixels and from having seen many traps in my time. These fucking memes were going to haunt me until the day I died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, wait, I've got a worse one. Of course there's a trap ahead, I'm standing right in front of her! Not that I had a dick right then, but, you know. Kind of a philosophical question: if a trans girl doesn't have a dick, is she a trap?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She narrowed her eyes at me, but I ignored her and started for the door we'd come in through. Everyone else, at least, was happy to do whatever I told them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was back through the door when she called out, "Is it this? This line of salt?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I twitched. "It's not the salt," I said. "That's stupid."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I brushed it aside for you," she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned to look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The line was still there, and she was smirking at me. "It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I set my jaw and didn't answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You're &lt;em&gt;embarrassed&lt;/em&gt;." Her grin broadened. "The demon is &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt; that she can't cross a line of salt!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Laugh at me," I growled. "See what happens."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing would happen. I wasn't allowed to harm the prisoners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expressions on the other prisoner's faces indicated that they very much did not want to see what would happen, but the vulpine murderess didn't seem worried at all. She licked her lips quickly and looked me up and down, a smile still dancing around her lips. Her tail wagged gently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was fucking &lt;em&gt;bratting&lt;/em&gt; at me. Very suddenly, images flashed through my mind of treating her &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how she was asking to be. Maybe I could even do it without &lt;em&gt;harming&lt;/em&gt; her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey, Mistress hadn't totally ground out all my dominant impulses!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My face must have revealed something of my thoughts, because she quickly turned away and scattered the salt with her foot. "There," she said. "We can go this way now."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I huffed in frustration and marched through the now-clear doorway. Almost out. The main hall would have been a good place for an ambush, a nice wide area that could let them take advantage of numbers, but maybe they didn't have that many numbers anymore? Also, if they were planning an ambush here, they wouldn't've left the salt line. As we crossed through the hall, I noted that the other doors were blocked by lines of salt as well, so we were probably home free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nothing stopped us as we exited the keep and crossed the bailey. No visible lanterns or torches along the top of the outer wall, either, though any guards up there had probably extinguished them for stealth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guards that had been stuck in the gatehouse weren't there anymore, so either they went out the front or somebody had let them into the bailey. Both portcullises were closed, though, so I sheathed my sword and set to cranking it open one-handed. I had to do it at something approximating normal speed — the mechanism would jam if I cranked it too fast — so it took several minutes. Then I led everyone through and started cranking open the outer portcullis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's what I was going to do, at least, but I was taken by surprise when as soon as I stepped through, the portcullis dropped again, released from a mechanism higher up in the gatehouse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hindered by my burden, I instinctively tried to leap forward. Except the blind guy was holding tight to my tail, and he couldn't help but yank on it as it tore from his grasp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I made an embarrassing noise. The blind man stumbled forward, into the path of the falling portcullis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free the prisoners and escort them out of the fortress. Typical bodyguard priorities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The memory of Mistress's voice echoed in my head, but I was stuck because leaping back to knock him out of the way might harm the woman I was carrying. Head still spinning from having my tail pulled so roughly, I hesitated a moment too long, then sprang at him and bounced off the portcullis as it slammed in my face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Fuck!" I yowled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through the stars flashing in my vision, I could see that the fox-girl had grabbed the man's shoulder and pulled him back, so that was good. She was proving herself to be more useful than I'd expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was another noise above me, and now I was trapped in the gatehouse with one of the prisoners. My strength and speed wouldn't do much to let me immediately escape; I couldn't bend a portcullis like I had the bars in the dungeon. I might be able to lift one, though, but I probably wouldn't have enough time, because…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember at the start of all this how I was thinking that I might end up getting boiling oil dumped on me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dropped my burden onto the stone floor, where she looked up at me with confused and fearful eyes. My face probably looked pretty wild. I didn't think this would kill me, probably, but it was sure going to hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Curl into a ball," I ordered. "Make yourself as small as possible."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was cooperative about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;, at least. With her shivering and clutching her ankles, I covered her as completely as I could with my body, then, as a last minute thought, stuffed one of my leather gloves between my teeth and bit down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt heat radiating down from above, but it didn't hurt nearly as much as I thought. In fact, it felt kind of nice compared to the chill of the air. Had Mistress put some kind of protection spell on me without telling me? Surprised, I twisted and looked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About six feet above me was a translucent magical barrier that was catching the boiling oil. Heat was radiating from the levitating pool. Dumbfounded, I looked back to the bailey to see the beastkin murderess with her arms outstretched and an expression of intense focus on her face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Significantly&lt;/em&gt; more useful than I'd expected. I patted the cowering woman on the face and, glove still clutched in my teeth, dashed to the inner portcullis, grabbed the bottom, and strained myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was way harder than bending the bars, but still, it probably weighed less than a car. Not that I'd actually been able to test out lifting a car, so I guess the comparison is pretty meaningless. My retinue acted quickly, ducking under as soon as there was enough room. Fox-girl was the last one, moving slowly and carefully to avoid ruining her concentration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I dropped the inner portcullis with a crash and raced to the outer gate. We were now in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dangerous situation — if that barrier dropped it would be total failure — so I heaved it up without wasting time listening to the complaints of my bones and muscles. Everyone passed through, even the reticent woman, and then I followed. As soon as I was clear, the spell dropped, dumping all the oil onto the ground at once. I sprang backward, narrowly dodging the splash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home stretch. This time I scooped up the blind guy and encouraged the rest of them to run with a wide sweeping gesture and drew my sword again. They all went eagerly, and I took up the rear, hopping backwards. Like I'd thought, the guards sent arrows after us, which I was able to swat out of the air before they could hit any of my ducklings. That felt cool and fun to do until I missed one and the arrow hit me in the leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once we had sufficient distance, I set the blind man back down next to the woman who had originally been leading him, ripped out the arrow, and healed it with magic. Finally, I spat the glove out of my mouth and pulled it back on my hand. There were tooth-holes in it. Probably if I'd actually gotten deep-fried I would have ripped it to shreds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little belatedly, I realized that we were all standing around in the dark and they probably were less used to it than I was, so I cast a light for them. The prisoners were looking at me expectantly, but something was nagging at the back of my mind. Had I forgotten something?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quickly, I mentally went over all of my orders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill anyone who draws against you or otherwise stands in your way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ah, fuck, the archers. They'd drawn against me, so I needed to deal with them. Boiling oil … eh, that wasn't a weapon that you draw or anything that stood in my way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So I got to climb up the wall like I had originally thought about, and ended up notching my sword three more times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the wall, I could see that the prisoners were still standing around. Probably they wouldn't be able to just head out into the darkness, so I gathered a couple of the torches from the people I'd killed, brought them down, and handed them around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Now what?" asked the older man. Several of the prisoners were shivering. It wasn't very warm out tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You're free!" I said, grinning and spreading my hands like I was announcing that they'd won a new car. "Go nuts!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Hellgirl, um. Respectfully…" the old woman paused, the one holding the blind man's hand, probably trying to figure out how to ask what she wanted while remaining polite. "Where should we … go?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No idea," I said. "This is as far as I can take you, and now I must return from whence I have come." I was already looking forward to getting back home, though it was going to be a long run cross-country to get there. Maybe I could lay my head in Mistress's lap and she'd pet my hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prisoners didn't like that answer very much, but they muttered among themselves and, after a few minutes, a group of them set off down the road while another ducked into the underbrush of the forest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Except one. The beastkin woman had been left out of the conference and followed no one. She hadn't taken a torch, either. Instead, she was looking up at the sky, deep in thought. I studied her, a little curious, until finally she nodded to herself, cast a light spell, and moved to go into the trees in a different direction from the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Before you take off," I said, because I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to know. "Before you &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt;, I mean, can I ask you a question?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She turned back toward me and gave me half of a smile. "You just saved my life. Yes, one question should clear our debt."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You've got magic. Those cells weren't enchanted or anything. You could've broken out whenever you wanted. Why didn't you?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I have a hard time imagining how a magical barrier or a light could have helped me escape."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Presumably you can cast other spells."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She laughed quietly. "With my charges, I was almost certainly going to be executed. But if I used my magic to escape … I probably would have been caught and killed right then and there." She shrugged. "I suppose I just wanted to live as long as possible."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm glad you did," I said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the one you were here to rescue?" Her eyes brightened and her tail wagged slightly. "Who sent you?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I laughed. "No," I said, answering neither question. "I just prefer it when people survive, is all."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A surprising sentiment, given—"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the fact that I'd directly murdered nineteen people tonight, I didn't want to hear her say. "Not my choice," I said, sharply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She started to respond, but suddenly I badly needed the conversation to be over. I ended it by quickly turning and sprinting out of sight fast enough that I would seem to have vanished. Demons usually get the last word when we want to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I clenched my fists. Stupid bitch, getting on my case for stuff I couldn't control. She should be grateful that Mistress had arbitrarily ordered me to rescue the prisoners instead of killing them. She should be thanking her beastkin gods that coin had come up heads rather than tails. Mistress was fickle, and I was sure that the fate of the prisoners had just been a way to screw with me and amuse herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; should thank her, I realized. I should thank her for allowing me to do something that felt heroic instead of slaughtering innocents. I shivered. I should get on the ground and kiss her feet and do whatever I needed to do so that she would let me rescue more people later. Even if those people weren't perfectly grateful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wave of needy submissiveness washed over me. Knowing that this attitude had been conditioned, that I had been warped by torture and magic and training into someone who thought these kinds of things, into someone who could remember a list of 30 orders and follow them perfectly, into someone whose submissive streak had been contorted into something that controlled her life, didn't help me resist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could be grateful &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; them. I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be grateful for them, grateful for Mistress's mercy. I would be good. Good. Good girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With thoughts of submitting for Mistress spinning in my head, I departed for home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carol has been best friends with Nolan for ten years, long before he ever knew her as Carol. Until recently, her feelings towards him have been one-sided, but her transition threatens to change their dynamic permanently. The Understudy is a short story about the complex relationship dynamics that many trans-women have to deal with in real life and how they affect them, it centers around a breakup told in a descending series of flashbacks that describe the relationship of the two main characters and how their dynamics have shifted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2143547-the-understudy/chapter/2143552/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;The Understudy&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gazed out the window and felt the last rays of the evening winter sun graze her skin. The faint rumbles of a nearby freight train rattled the building gently. She’s alone in her mind for a brief moment in time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind her, the bed buckles and the springs creak. She twitches as she feels a cool hand trace the nape of her neck down to her shoulder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“-rol. Carol. You ok? Hey!” The voice echoed faintly in her ears, like hearing a phone call through a thin wall, and she turned her gaze slowly to meet his. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, yeah I’m fine,” she strained, “you want another round, or was that &lt;i&gt;‘her’&lt;/i&gt; calling you?” She’s trying desperately to hide the disdain in her voice, but she’s failing miserably, and he can tell&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to talk about her like that you know. She’s really not-”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah I get it, I get it. I’m sorry, just forget it. Go. I know you’ve been waiting to…” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He hesitated for a moment, before scooting up to the edge of the bed with her, “I can stay a bit longer.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She wanted to tell him to go. To fuck off, that it was over, and that she never wanted to see him again. But that would mean she would be alone. Well and truly alone. Anything would be better than that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just. Stay…” she muttered, before resting her head gently against his shoulder. He was warm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah… yeah OK,” he said softly as he stroked her hair. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As they sat in the silence, Carol’s mind filled with memories of the past. How did she do this to herself?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;1 Year Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carol tugged uncomfortably at the skirt that currently clung to her, “Are you sure it looks alright?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lily nodded vigorously, “You look GREAT,” and she wasn’t lying. The skirt was one of Lily’s old ones, and it was at least two sizes too small, but Carol had managed to squeeze into it somehow. Afterwards, they gave her a little bit of light makeup and a top to match it. She really did look lovely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She gave a shy smile and turned to look back in the mirror, “Yeah… I guess I do.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 Years Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron sat in the booth quietly. It had been a little over two years since he’d last seen Nolan. They’d been best friends since the seventh grade, but college had other plans, and their schedules never seemed to align. Nolan had gone and crashed and burned out in Montana while Cameron had made the choice to stay behind in Washington. It’d been so long. Maybe he’d finally be brave enough to tell him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before he could lose himself in thought, Nolan walked in. With… a girl. Cameron had no idea who this was for a brief moment, but once he did, he felt his stomach drop. This was that girl Nolan had been on and on about as of late. He was pretty sure her name was… &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey! Cameron, this is Anna!” Nolan proclaimed as he made his way over to the table. He was wearing that stupid grin that always softened Cameron’s mood, no matter how foul. Before he could react, Nolan had pulled him out of the booth into a colossal bear hug. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron tensed for a second, before inevitably melting fully into the embrace. Nolan was warm. Soft but strong, less like an athlete and more like a manual laborer. He was the only person taller than Cameron, and that was the best part. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She could have stayed like that forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d been fully prepared to, until a shrill voice pierced his ears and brought him crashing back to reality, “Oh my god! You’re Cameron! So nice to meet my boyfriend's &lt;i&gt;boyfriend&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron froze for a moment as he heard this, before awkwardly recovering, “Y-yeah, that’s me haha. Nice to meet you too,” he said as he tried to remember the basics of socialization. They sat down and struck a friendly conversation, but Cameron hadn’t been very chatty. He kept stealing glances at Anna, and every time he did, the sense of dread he felt in his chest only grew more and more powerful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Oh God,’ &lt;/i&gt;he thought, &lt;i&gt;‘She’s beautiful…’ &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;4 Years Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hate this, why are we going so far?” Cameron grumbled. His feet were sore, and he’d already been whacked in the face by several branches so far. They had been walking for at least forty-five minutes, and Nolan &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; wouldn’t tell him where they were going. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’ll just-have to-wait and seeeeee,” Nolan said in a sing-songy voice. For a brief moment Cameron considered throwing something at him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ugh, you’re an ass,” he shot back. He wanted to say something else, but was frankly too tired to complain anymore. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’d continue to walk for another twenty minutes, but Cameron swore up and down it was a whole extra hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, Nolan had piped up, “We’re here!” Cameron whipped his head up at the sudden announcement and finally saw where Nolan had guided them. It was a small cliff face overlooking the river. The sun was casting a fiery orange glow across the water's surface, and a cool summer breeze grazed his skin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here, siddown,” Nolan gestured to the rocks at the top of the cliff face. Cameron looked down and finally figured out why Nolan had wanted to come here. Not only was it beautiful, the rocks at the top of the cliff face had been worn in such a way that they were perfectly chair shaped. For a moment, Cameron thought of all the couples who must have come here before them before taking his seat next to Nolan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ta-da!” Cameron turned his head to see what Nolan had been so proud about and saw in his hands two messy, bright green joints. “I rolled ‘em myself, what do you think?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wanted to laugh. Really badly. But the look on Nolan’s face was just so earnest that he simply stifled it and said “Wow, yeah man that looks great.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Dick,” he chuckled. Apparently, this hadn’t been as smooth as he thought, and Nolan slugged him on the arm gently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here,” he said while passing the joint to Cameron, “light it will ya? I always end up choking.” Cameron took it to mouth before flicking the lighter a few times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh mother-” Cameron cursed under his breath as he continuously flicked at the flighter. No matter how hard he tried, the wind would simply snuff the flame as soon as he lit it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here,” Nolan said as he inched closer and held out his hands to cover the lighter. Cameron’s heart skipped a beat as he got closer, and he had no idea why. As he leaned in to shelter the little lighter from the wind, he could smell cologne mixed faintly with sweat and the faint notes of tree sap from their walk. In that brief moment, all Cameron could think about was how badly she wanted Nolan to kiss her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;6 Years Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron felt the wind fly out of him as he hit the ground. He let out an exasperated groan and grumbled, “Do we really have to play on the same football team?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nolan pulled him to his feet, “Because you said you would! It’ll be fun, I swear.” Cameron brushed the grass off his shorts and grabbed a drink of water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah… if you say so,” he said as he made his way over to the shade under the trees to sit down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nolan quickly followed suit and sat next to him quietly. He looked at Cameron and saw the pained expression on his face. Something wasn’t sitting right with him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Be honest… do you actually want to play?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron looked shocked for a moment, then guilty, “...No, not really. It's just. Everyone here keeps telling me ‘Oh you’re so tall, why aren’t you playing football!’ and I just. I don’t know, I guess I felt like I was obligated to. It’s what we’re supposed to do. Right?” Cameron paused for a moment before sheepishly adding, “Plus, we’d get to hangout more…” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well why did you say so!” It suddenly all made sense, Cameron had always been kind of self-conscious about his height, though Nolan never really understood why. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I just didn’t want to upset you I guess.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re not gonna upset me, I’d rather just keep hanging out like normal instead of making you miserable all the time!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Really?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course! We’re best friends right?” Nolan spoke those last words with so much pride that Cameron could feel himself tearing up a little. Before he could react, Nolan’s arms wrapped around him and pulled him in for a tight, warm embrace. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And she felt her anxiety melt away. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;8 Years Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron trudged along the mud covered track, picking at the ill-fitting gym uniform their middle school had forced them to wear. He hadn’t been paying attention at that point, he just wanted this to be over already. His legs ached, he was caked in mud, his lungs burned and his forehead was sticky with sweat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d seen Nolan a couple times in passing, but the much more athletic boy had managed to keep a consistent pace, so Cameron only saw him when he lapped the track. He’d been content with this setup, until he ran into another boy on the track named Logan. They’d never gotten along, and today was no exception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Heyyyy, look at Cameron! He’s all by himself today. Guess his boyfriend didn’t feel like dealing with him today.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron felt his ears go bright red and in a moment of embarrassment and impulsivity, he whipped his body around to look at him, “Fuck off Logan, he’s not my boyfriend,” he snapped. He knew he shouldn’t give him the time of day, but he was far too exhausted for rational decision making at this point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ooo look at that, he can speak by himself. Normally his little butt buddy does it for him. Do you need us to go get him for you sweetheart?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I said leave me alone,” Cameron said as he hunkered down and picked up the pace. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey where you going! We’re just joking, that's all!” Logan laughed as they caught up with Cameron easily. He was too tired to outpace them. “Come on, quit being such a little fa-” he was interrupted by the loud crack of Cameron’s fist on his face. Immediately, Cameron knew what he had done and he went deathly pale before turning on his heel to sprint away. Before he could get away however, one of the boys standing next to Logan wrapped his arm around his neck and held Cameron in place as the other two boys took turns taking cheap shots at him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron kicked vigorously but it was no use, the boy who had him was far stronger. It seemed like he was destined for a beating. But all of a sudden, the blows simply quit as a large silhouette plowed into Logan, knocking him to the ground. It was Nolan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“FUCK OFF. ALL OF YOU,” he shouted at the other boys before turning his gaze to Logan, “Don’t you ever touch my friends again,” he said. As menacing as was trying to be, Cameron found it a little hard to take the sweet boy seriously. Though it seems Logan had no similar problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Y-yeah, sorry man…” he meekly squeaked out before running off to catch up with the other boys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nolan quickly turned his gaze to Cameron, “Are you OK?! What happened?” He asked frantically as he searched Cameron for obvious wounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah I’m fine, swear it, thanks to you.” Cameron reassured him. He knew that Nolan’s timing didn’t exactly do anything to dissuade the rumours. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she didn’t care. She was just glad he was here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Present Day&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You alright?” She heard Nolan ask faintly. She was back in the room. Her mind locked firmly in the present.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She looked into his eyes, searching for a feeling. She was hoping for concern, maybe even anger or annoyance at her behavior. But no. It was the same look she’d seen time and time again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was &lt;i&gt;pity&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in that moment she knew he didn’t love her. Not like that. She would be cursed, some fragile broken thing designed to be nothing but pitied and used and discarded later, doomed to forever play the understudy to the whirlwind romance the two of them starred in. The &lt;i&gt;normal&lt;/i&gt; couple. Whenever he was bored, whenever she left town, whenever he would broach the barrier of love and affection that defined friend and &lt;i&gt;girl&lt;/i&gt;friend, she would be there. Waiting for him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Fuck that,’ &lt;/i&gt;she thought. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She couldn’t do it anymore. She was awash in a wave of disgust, anger, love and &lt;i&gt;contempt&lt;/i&gt;. Contempt for him, contempt for Anna, contempt for &lt;i&gt;herself&lt;/i&gt;. When had she become so pathetic? Better yet, when had he? What had happened to the sweet, brave, honest boy she’d been best friends with. &lt;i&gt;That she fell in love with. &lt;/i&gt;Was it her fault?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She sat there, wordlessly. Time seemingly slowed to a crawl, and the dreadful silence lingered like a cloud of invisible poison. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, she let go. She pulled her head from his shoulder and gently dropped his hand before placing a single, tender kiss on his lips before standing up, and walking out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;10 Years Ago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron looked up and down at his schedule frantically. It was his first day of middle school in a new town, and he was terrified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d been assigned a tour guide to show him around, another student named Aiden. But when lunch time had rolled around, Aiden ditched him, leaving him to figure out where the last of his classes would be. And he was starting to panic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d been too afraid to ask anyone for help, not that they seemed inclined to lend it. All except one boy who seemed to notice his panic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, are you alright? You look a little lost.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Um, yeah, a little.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here, show me your schedule.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron did as he was told and submitted his schedule for an inspection. The boy took it and started combing through. As he did, a flash realization struck him like a lightning bolt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Wait, you’re the new kid!” It wasn’t a question so much as it was a statement and it caught Cameron off guard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ha ha, yeah… you got me,” Cameron chuckled awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What happened to your guide? It was supposed to be Aiden, yeah?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I think he got bored or something. I haven’t seen him for a while.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Without another word, the other boy threw his arm around Cameron’s shoulders in an over-exaggerated fashion and started them forwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well no worries, I’ll be your guide! Stick with me, I know EVERYTHING about this place,” he beamed triumphantly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“O-oh. Really? Thanks…” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah, what’s your name by the way?” The boy asked&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s Cameron. What’s yours”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m Nolan! It’s good to meet you!” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;…&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay is a meticulous barista, living his life with discipline and care: he will not be like other men; he will be better than them. But his coworker and roommate Herb renders this goal near impossible by being an all-around nuisance. Doesn't help that he's also hot...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But everything changes when they stumble upon a pair of very special shark plushies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I Hugged a Blåhaj Too Tight and Turned Into a Sharkgirl is a 20k words self-indulgent, horny, and comedic romance between two trans girls with very different takes on life, work, and identity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2120427-i-hugged-a-blhaj-too-tight-and-turned-into-a-sharkgirl/chapter/2120431/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter One: The Reward of a Job Well Done&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;div class="wi_news"&gt; &lt;div class="wi_news_title"&gt;&lt;i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px;"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Announcement&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wi_news_body"&gt;Hello hello hello! Sorry for the big hiatus on here. 2025 wasn’t a great year for me writing-wise, but I did complete one story, this one! It was a really fun project to work on, and I hope you’ll have as much fun reading it as I had writing it :) The whole story &lt;em&gt;(including an exclusive 2,5k words smut scene)&lt;/em&gt; is available now on my &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/collection/1472846?view=expanded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;patreon&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll also be able to read the first chapter of my upcoming vampire story as soon as I finish it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And quick reminder that my transbian minecraft youtuber silly romance Face Reveal is available as an epub on itch: &lt;a href="https://aquerelle.itch.io/face-reveal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;https://aquerelle.itch.io/face-reveal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="sp-wrap sp-wrap-default"&gt; &lt;div class="sp-head" title="Expand"&gt; Whole Story Content Warnings &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="sp-body folded"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internalised transphobia, misogyny, sex (fade to black) and mentions of sex&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="spdiv"&gt;[collapse]&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s weird is that Willow asked us not to &lt;i&gt;hug&lt;/i&gt; the new blåhaj,” Jay says. “And, like, what kind of warning is that—”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tut-tut-tut.” Herb cuts him off, leans back on the marble counter, right in between the cash-till and the grinder, and shakes his stupid blonde head in disapproval, avoiding Jay’s eyes. “I’ll stop you right there, buddy. It is not blew-hi, but &lt;i&gt;blow&lt;/i&gt;-hi. Repeat after me. Blooow-hi.” He pinches the air, lifting his hand at the ‘blå’ and dropping it at the ‘haj’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herb is Jay’s coworker. He’s a hottie, a nerd, and a pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blew-hi,” Jay indulges him. It’s not like any of them speak Swedish anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herb chuckles and waggles his index. “Mm, that’s not it. Blow. Like a… Like blow! You say blew, I say &lt;i&gt;blooow.&lt;/i&gt; Hear that little difference?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, Jay doesn’t really hear that little difference. It sounds exactly the same to his ear. Okay, maybe not the &lt;i&gt;same &lt;/i&gt;same, but he pronounced the ‘u’ almost like an ‘o’ and Herb pronounced the ‘o’ almost like an ‘u’ and for the last time, they don’t speak Swedish, aren’t planning on learning it, and they don’t even serve meatballs; it’s the fucking chic little café of a private swimming pool, not IKEA. So what gives? Who cares? Jay just wanted to warn him about Willow’s plushie policy, not fight about &lt;i&gt;linguistics.&lt;/i&gt; Herb’s starting to piss him off with a useless debate — again — and wasting valuable work time — &lt;i&gt;again. &lt;/i&gt;One day, that boy is going to get them fired, and then they won’t be able to pay their rent any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because yes, Herb is Jay’s coworker, but he’s also, regretfully, his roommate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blew,” Jay says, making a constructive attempt not to groan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep it professional. There are customers. There are tasks to attend to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herb’s eyes flicker up to meet Jay’s for a second. Deep, mesmerising, brown eyes, long lashes — all of which, for the record, are outright wasted on a &lt;i&gt;boy, &lt;/i&gt;especially one named &lt;i&gt;Herb&lt;/i&gt; — and a scowl that makes Jay’s heart skip a beat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blow!” Herb says, slamming his hand flat on the counter and raising his voice just high enough for the closest table to pick up on it and stare at the two waiters. Damn it, if he continues being this obnoxious, he really is going to get them fired, and he’s going to get them fired &lt;i&gt;today&lt;/i&gt; with a tortious interference suit to boot. “Uu. Oh. Uu. Oh. See? Just relax your tongue a little. It’s not that hard!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah, whatever. Blow, blue, bleh. &lt;i&gt;Blah, blah, blah.”&lt;/i&gt; Jay looks over Herb’s shoulder and shouts, “Excuse him! He’s been feeling rather stressed out lately.” Then he approaches Herb, whispers, “You’re making a scene,” and pulls the pretty boy by the arm, almost closing the gap between them, learning in the process that, today, Herb smells like pine and wood chips. “And keep your hands off the counter. I just got it cleaned.” To prove his point, he produces a wet washcloth from his apron’s front pocket and wipes the counter once more, never breaking eye contact. Giving him the stink eye. Letting him know the measure of his annoyance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herb snorts and slaps his hand on Jay’s back. “Aww, look at you. Isn’t it adorable when you’re scared to admit defeat? Ooh, yes it is. Yes it is.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Great, now he’s talking to Jay not only like a dog, which is humiliating enough, but &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; dog, which is way, way worse. Bringing back gross memories of getting stuck in the trenches of the school social ladder. Memories he prefers stay firmly locked in the High School Experience part of his mind, next to all-time classics like witnessing the ways boys behave behind their locker room’s doors when adults and girls are gone, or being the sidekick of a sidekick of an almost but not quite popular guy for two consecutive years. The days of being people’s pet are long gone. He swats Herb’s hand away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By the way,” Herb continues unperturbed, “aren’t you supposed to take the orders? I’m the one on bar duty today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay sighs. “Then let’s swap.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sorry to break the news, but you, my guy, have no sense of hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No sense of— You’re the cuter one! We get more tips when you take orders.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cuter one. As if. Jay rolls his eyes and continues wiping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Waiter!” someone suddenly shouts, rattling a spoon on his empty glass. Both Jay and Herb turn to look at him. It’s their worst customer, a graying man, dressed to the nines, who always sits at the furthest spot from the bar, in order to be able to see all customers and waiters in front of him and still be able to check on the saltwater pool he’s so proud of to his left. It’s the manager. He’s leaning on the large glass window that spans from one end of the café to the other for at least eighteen metres of uninterrupted glass — one of the largest in the world, he would point out — and he looks positively annoyed. It’s the manager, and it’s &lt;i&gt;urgent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The waiters look at each other intensely, but Jay refuses to move; he even takes a step back towards the sink, smirking. He’s already won this one. His hands are all wet, and Herb is closer to the bar’s exit. There’s only one solution that is both timely and doesn’t involve getting dangerously close to each other again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fine,” Herb eventually says, almost growls, “but next time you do the dishes, I will tie you up, and I’m not even kidding!” Then he takes an empty plate and marches up to the glass window, not wasting a second. He’s just fast enough to show that his priority is the customer’s satisfaction, but stays steady and professional and avoids making his steps echo down the hall. He’s &lt;i&gt;good.&lt;/i&gt; One more reason for him to take orders. He’s got a way better swagger than Jay’s bulky and awkward trot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Way better ass, too, but that’s beside the point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay starts pouring water on the dishes, deciding then and there that he’s done with Herb for the day, and that he wouldn’t warn him about Willow’s new blåhaj. Wouldn’t even mention it again. His loss. If there was something fishy going on with their other roommate’s shark plush, Herb will discover it the hard way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;&lt;b&gt;˙ 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞 𓆝 𓆟 .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s late, and he’s back at home, at the sink again. Herb is taking his daily hour-long shower, and Willow is asleep; she’s probably been asleep since before they came back. It’s &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; late. But there were dirty plates, forks, and spoons, and Jay hates waking up to a crowded sink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s always preferred staying behind the bar. He’s good at grinder dialling, puck prep, milk frothing and latte art, and he knows how to properly clean. The more dirty glasses pile up in the kitchen, the more he feels like it’s his duty to clean them all, and the more he cleans them, the more he’s at peace; it’s meditative. It’s like he’s making amends for his sins. He might be an uptight stickler, but at least he’s not like those guys who mull around doing nothing, or worse, those who pretend they’re some kind of feminist because they do the bare minimum. No, Jay is a serious man: be that at home or at the café, he does the job, he does it well, and he doesn’t ask anything in return. The reward of a job well done is plenty enough. And what’s more, Herb always leaves specks and smudges, which is not up to par for a café like the one they work at. Not up to par at all, really.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why Jay loves taking care of the dishes at home, too. That, and cooking, and vacuuming, and all-around cleaning the place. His tolerance for filth is way lower than Herb’s, and he would never &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; let Willow clean. As a woman, she already has too much nonsense to deal with, so making her feel as if she has to take care of the chores is the last thing Jay wants. He’s even terrified of the idea, if he’s entirely honest. He’d hate to be like Herb: a dirty, macho deadbeat who doesn’t even know how to wash his own clothes. The prime example of everything wrong with men, despite not exactly looking the part, what with his long hair and perfectly shaven face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus, at the café, he cleans. And at home, he cleans. And he likes it. It gives him purpose and offers him a way out when life is too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granted he doesn’t stare into a spoon for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, the handle is rather pretty; its curves flow and twist like petals and thorns. It reminds him of his mother, who collected beautiful souvenir spoons from all over the world, and it makes him wonder again if he doesn’t want to do the same as her one day. Yes, also, the bowl of the spoon is old and rugged, busy with indents and budding rust. He briefly tries to remember where and when he acquired it, what the story behind it is, and if it isn’t time to replace it. But those observations only accounted for a minute, give or take, of his fascination for the spoon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No, the twenty-nine others are spent on his face, reflected in the back of the spoon. Distorted. Crude. Obscenely crude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He brings it close, so close, until he is reduced to a blurry brown. And the world fades out for a while; he gets a little sense of peace. Then, methodically, he slides it further and further away from his eyes, and slowly, his features appear. His nose, sweaty and hairy. His brow, thick and dishevelled. And his jaw, square and uneven. The whole thing looks unfamiliar. Uncanny. What is all of that? It’s human, it’s a man, it’s him, presumably, but he has trouble believing it. And he’s engrossed with the feeling it gives him; it’s like repeating a word over and over until it loses all meaning and sounds alien. His face looks alien. That’s fun — right? He shivers. Then he brings the spoon closer again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are you doing?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spoon slips out of his grip and falls in the sink with a clang as Jay turns towards the hallway. Herb’s leaning by the wall with a towel wrapped around his chest and another around his blonde locks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay struggles to come up with a sensible answer. Even after three months of living together, he has a lot of struggle seeing Herb naked — even partially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s one A.M. You should sleep. We’re working early tomorrow.” Herb doesn’t even look at him twice. “Bip-bip.” He makes a shoo-shoo gesture with his hand. “Scuttle over. I want ice cream.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The—” Jay clears his throat. “The fridge is right there; you can open it. Why should I move?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey, just… Come on, do me a favour and scuttle over. What? Would you &lt;i&gt;die &lt;/i&gt;if you got more than a metre away from the kitchen?” Herb mumbles something under his breath, and Jay is pretty sure that it’s not a remark befitting of the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Why would I need to—” Jay closes his eyes for a moment. Keep calm. Do not get into his game. “The fridge is right there.” He waves his hand towards it; he’s right, the fridge is plenty accessible, a good metre away from the sink. He really is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; in the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Acutely grasped, my friend.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then, open it. Get your snack. Go to your room.” Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herb shakes his head and chuckles. “See, that won’t do, &lt;i&gt;mum.&lt;/i&gt; What you don’t understand is that I need &lt;i&gt;space&lt;/i&gt;. Eating ice cream at one A.M. is, like, an &lt;i&gt;art&lt;/i&gt;.” He closes the distance between them, punctuating each word with a step. “I want to get on the floor, lean on the counter, fridge door open to my side, and &lt;i&gt;savour&lt;/i&gt; that ice cream. Lick it, sigh happily, then lick it again, and smile. That’s how you eat ice cream at one A.M.” He steps back. “Now, be a good boy, move.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay’s breathing picks up. He doesn’t understand. Why does Herb have to always, &lt;i&gt;always&lt;/i&gt;, make some sort of joke, some sort of argument, out of every little thing he says or does? Why does Herb have to smirk and look at him like he was some kind of idiot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on. Move.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He should have listened to Willow. She warned him about Herb. That he is mean and chaotic. That working with him is one thing, but &lt;i&gt;living&lt;/i&gt; with him day to day is another totally. &lt;i&gt;‘im not sure youd be able to resist him more than a month tbhhhh so good luck lmaozihgbziefiqzef,’&lt;/i&gt; she texted him, and he should’ve listened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And why couldn’t Herb leave him the fuck alone? He was in his zone, even if his zone was staring at a spoon. Maybe we should normalise spoon staring in our off-hours. Maybe sometimes, the most relaxing thing you can do is stare at a spoon. Can’t he get a single moment without being reminded of the existence of Herb?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Jesus, man. &lt;i&gt;Mooove.&lt;/i&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, that’s it. He tenses up. He’s sick of Herb. Sick of the pointless debates in the middle of their shift, sick of his dirty little hands putting their mark on everything in their home, sick of all the smirks and smug looks. He can’t take it any more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“FINE!” Jay yells and time stops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fuck. &lt;/i&gt;He hears his heart pumping blood to his face, his jaw, his brow, his nose. &lt;i&gt;Fuck, fuck, fuck. &lt;/i&gt;He’s breathing faster, clutching the counter. &lt;i&gt;That’s it, I’ve gone mad.&lt;/i&gt; And he doesn’t even move. Not yet. He can’t. He can’t because worry flashes in the other boy’s eyes for a second. &lt;i&gt;Fuck. &lt;/i&gt;Jay’s just as bad as Herb, isn’t he?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it’s Herb, and Herb doesn’t know how to be anything other than a pest, so of course, of fucking course, he says, “Well, if you don’t move, I’ll have to lean on your lap.” Then he smiles again. “What a shame.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You— I— Fuck— Ugh.” Jay is almost panting at this point. He has to find some kind of witty answer, some kind of retort that would shut Herb off or make him laugh. Or both. But he’s panting and his head feels like a furnace and it’s one A.M and he’s been staring at a spoon for thirty minutes and he feels like he’s about to cry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh god, he &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;about to cry. Why is he about to cry?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has no way out except running away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So that’s what he does. And he doesn’t even look back as he makes a beeline for the hallway. His room is just behind the corner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Jay?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fuck.&lt;/i&gt; He picks up the pace but trips on something and almost falls over. Two blåhajs. One blue, one pink. Laying on the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wipes his tears one last time, picks the blue one, opens his room, locks his door, keels over, and holds on to the shark for dear life. And then he cries into its fur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High School superstar quarterback, Kyle Patterson has a great arm, a gorgeous girlfriend, and a glorious future awaiting him. All of which gets jeopardized when he acquires Acute Chromosomal Recombination Syndrome and finds the physical changes are only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2140974-acrs/chapter/2141021/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A.C.R.S – Chapter 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first sign that something was wrong was when I’d fainted at practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hadn’t felt well since waking up that morning, but I figured the brief flashes of fatigue, coupled with random bouts of gut-twisting nausea, were simply from the pressure of trying to lead my team to another state championship. After a rocky start at the beginning of the season, we’d finally found our rhythm, winning the next four games straight. Five more and we were guaranteed a top spot in the playoffs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunched over behind Roman Merrick’s protruding ass with my hands between his legs, I burped in the middle of calling the play, sending a blast of foul-tasting bile surging up to the top of my throat. Grimacing, I forced it back down and managed to croak out the last word. Roman’s arms moved back to put the ball in my hands while the rest of the offensive line sprang into action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hopped back two steps, ignoring the sloshing sensation taking place in my stomach, and looked downfield for an open receiver. The defense pushed to get through to stop me, but Roman, along with David Michaels, Lou Jones, and Steve Holland, gave me the necessary seconds to do what I needed to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Josh Hutchins, my best friend since the moment we crashed our bikes into each other’s the summer before fifth grade, waved one arm wildly as he sprinted laterally across the field about two dozen yards from the line of scrimmage. His coverage, Markus Dellinger, was a good six or seven steps behind him, leaving Josh wide open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing back my arm, I hurled the ball toward Josh just as a wave of vertigo slammed across me. The world pitched sharply to the left, and I suddenly found myself unable to remain upright. Darkness swallowed me whole, and the next thing I knew, I was lying on my back staring up at the mid-October afternoon sky, blinking through the fog clouding my brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A shrill whistle cut through the confused haze, and Roman’s grinning face appeared above me, holding out his hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s the matter, Kyle? You get sleepy?” His grin turned slightly lecherous. “If Kerri-Ann doesn’t stop keeping you up all night, Coach is gonna make you break up with her.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took the offered assistance and let Roman pull me to my feet. The intense nausea still rolled through me, but I succeeded in remaining upright. I waited to see if the vertigo would return as well. When it didn’t, I forced a smile I didn’t feel on my face and shrugged one shoulder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not Kerri’s fault, Ro,” I said. “That throw was just so pretty it’s beauty made me swoon.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe next time wait to see if Hutchins actually catches the damned thing first,” the gruff voice of Coach Costanza snarled from behind me. “And if you want to swoon, you can put in a transfer to join the cheerleaders.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Josh walked up, pulling off his helmet and shaking out his thick mane of dirty blonde hair as he grinned like a happy fool. “Kyle would like that too much, Coach. It would greatly increase his opportunities to put his hands on the body of a hot girl.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coach’s twisted into a disappointed frown. “If you drop another easy pass, Hutchins, not only will you spend the one spending the rest of the season on the sidelines with the Raiderettes, you’ll also be dressed in their uniform.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pulled off my own helmet, trying not to laugh at either Josh or Coach. Not that their banter, a staple of our practices, wasn’t funny. I just wasn’t completely sure that laughing wouldn’t lead to me barfing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t do that to Josh, Coach,” Roman said as he winked at me. “We can’t win if everyone’s eyes are bleeding. The only way it could be worse is if it was Kyle.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I drew back my arm and punched my friend in the shoulder. “Speak for yourself, Bucko. I could rock a cheer skirt like nobody’s business.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course, you would, you fucking pussy,” Markus Dellinger said with a sneer as he walked past us. “You and Hutchins probably dress up in pink silk nighties before giving each other blow jobs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coach Costanza’s head swiveled in Marks’ direction, eyes narrowing at the hulking safety. “How about you worry less about your teammates and focus more on blocking to your left, Dellinger? Otherwise, you’ll be the one playing in a nightie.” Then he looked at the rest of us milling around. “That’s it, men. Gather up your gear and go home. We will go at it again tomorrow afternoon. Jones, make sure you rewrap that knee.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rest of the team signaled their acknowledgment and began to move off the field toward the parking lot. Josh stayed next to me as Coach waited until everyone else was out of earshot. Then he turned to look at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You sure you’re okay, Patterson? What happened?” The rough edge in his voice, the one he called his “Hardass Tone” was gone, replaced by genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wasn’t about to tell the man responsible for controlling my future that I’d fainted for no reason. So, I simply nodded and smiled. “I’m good, Coach. Promise. Just got a bit lightheaded for a moment, that’s all. Probably didn’t eat enough at lunch.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those steel gray eyes studied me for a moment, as if preparing to call me out on my lie. Instead, he sighed and returned the nod. “Good. We’re going up against Western in two weeks. Need my star quarterback in game-winning shape.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I gave him a jaunty salute. “Yes, sir. I promise to be in perfect shape by then.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What the hell happened, dude?” Josh asked as we walked off the field to where our own things were waiting. “You got lightheaded due to not eating? What the fuck? Man, you had two helpings of that nasty chicken casserole at lunch today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I picked up my backpack, surprised to find it seemed heavier than usual. I might have suspected one of the guys had put weights in it to prank me if not for the fact the buckles holding the flap closed were still fastened tight. Shrugging it onto my shoulder, I looked from Josh to the empty space around us, and back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I woke up this morning with a bitch of a migraine that hurt so damned bad it made my hair ache. It was gone by the time I got to school, but I’ve been feeling tired and nauseous for pretty much the entire day. When I threw the ball, everything just sort of went … dark for a moment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Josh’s grin vanished in a millisecond. “You sure didn’t act like you were nauseous at lunch. You were scarfing like you hadn’t eaten in days.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nodded. “It’s so fucking weird. But don’t say anything to anyone, okay? I’m sure it’s nothing. Probably just not enough sleep or maybe something I ate. That casserole was a bit nasty.” I clapped him on the shoulder. “I’ll be fine by tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kerri-Ann was waiting for me at my car, scrolling through her phone while looking both bored and annoyed. The brunette cheerleader glanced up, crystal blue eyes looking at me with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Did you really pass out at practice?” She said as she held up the phone, to show me a string of texts from the cheer squad’s group chat. “Sarah Miller said that Meghan Cowen told her that Bobby Jacobs said you fainted or something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I frowned. Bobby was a motormouth who had made it his mission to share any bit of gossip with the entire school. He was worse than a girl when it came to keeping secrets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t eat enough at lunch and my blood sugar dropped during practice. No big deal. And, for the record, I didn’t faint. I just got lightheaded and sat down.” Sure, it was a bald-faced lie. But Bobby was also known to embellish the hell out of his stories. “I’m fine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I opened the driver’s side door of the vintage Camaro and put my bag and gear into the back seat. Then I went around and opened the passenger door so my girlfriend could get in. Normally I would have taken the opportunity to get a really good look at the legs peeking out from the hem of her skirt, but the swirling still roaming around my belly made me just want to get home as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kerri-Ann spent most of the ride to her house on her phone, texting back and forth. We’d been dating for almost a year, though recently I’d begun to think she dated me for the boost it gave to her popularity. She’d just been another member of the cheer squad when we started going out. Less than three months later, she’d been promoted to assistant captain. She currently had her eye on the top position and breaking up with the star quarterback would not be beneficial to achieving her goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hope you’re not coming down with something,” she said as she finally put the phone down and looked over at me. “Homecoming is next month, you know.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I gripped the steering wheel tighter and tried not to sigh. She’d been going on and on about Homecoming even before the damn season started. I was pretty sure she hoped that being crowned Queen would be the final push that would topple Jennifer Sutton’s long-standing reign at Head Raiderette.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes, I know.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Well, I’m not sitting at home because you have a sniffle.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I gave her an angry stare but didn’t respond. Not only was I painfully aware that a fight with Kerri-Ann was not how I wanted to end my day, I could also feel the nausea from earlier attempting to return.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After dropping her off at her place, I headed straight home. I was almost there when the swimmy sensation in my stomach moved lower. Much lower. I kept my foot on the gas, pushing as much past the speed limit as I dared. Luckily, the rest of the way home was along a two-lane country road that was rarely, if ever, patrolled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I leapt out of the Camaro the second I was in the driveway, abandoning it in favor of getting inside and to a bathroom before I had an embarrassing accident. My mother, standing in front of the stove stirring something that should have smelled delicious, but only increased my nausea, gave me a worried look as I blew past her to the half-bathroom just off the living room. I didn’t trust myself to try getting upstairs without an incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t know how long I was in there, but by the time I was done, I was pretty sure there was nothing left in my stomach or intestines. I left the bathroom with a sweat-soaked brow and shaky legs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kyle?” My mother called out when I emerged. “Are you okay?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nodded, then shook my head. “I think I might have eaten something at lunch today that didn’t agree with me.” Of course, the memories of the pounding migraine I’d woken with and the incident during practice made me pretty sure that this was more than just a case of food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frowning, she placed her hand on my shoulder and reached up to put the back of her hand against my forehead. Given the difference in our heights, she had to stand on her toes to do it. After a second or two, she removed her hand and shook her head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re burning up. Go upstairs and get into bed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head and pointed at the back door. “I can’t. My stuff is still in the car and I’ve got homework.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My normally easy-going, non-assertive mother looked like she was about to retract her orders. Then her eyes moved from my face to the way my hands trembled. “Bed. Now. I’ll get your bags from the car and put them at the bottom of the stairs. Your father can bring them up when he gets home.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started to argue further, mainly because I didn’t want to hear a lecture from my dad about being responsible for my own stuff. But my body stopped me. I didn’t think I’d be able to stay on my feet for much longer, and passing out again wouldn’t do anything to help my case that I was fine. I nodded silently and slowly climbed the stairs to my room, going immediately over to the bed and passing out in a dark, dreamless sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I finally woke, the room was pitch black and the blankets wrapped around me were damp. As were my clothes, though it seemed my mom had come at some points and taken off my shoes. Slowly, I sat up, thankful that my stomach seemed somewhat happier than it had earlier, though not completely better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glancing over at the nightstand, I saw that it was just after midnight. Maybe I’d just caught some short-lived bug and just needed to sweat it out of my system. The relief that it wasn’t as bad as I’d feared faded the moment I stood up and my pants slipped down to rest lower on my hips. I shoved my fingers into the waistband and found far more room than usual between the denim and the sticky damp flesh of my abdomen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Panicking, I stumbled over to turn on the desk lamp and turned to look in the mirror hanging on the inside of the open closet door. The soaking wet red t-shirt, the left breast bearing the image of a pirate with the words “Raider Football” beneath, was much looser than it should have been. I grabbed the top of my jeans and pulled them away from me, staring as I discovered the gap was larger than I originally thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, I’d pretty much emptied my internal organs earlier, but even the worst case of stomach flu wouldn’t account for the fact that I looked like I’d lost twenty pounds. Or a few inches, which I noticed when I glanced down at my feet. I wasn’t just getting thinner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was getting &lt;em&gt;smaller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shaking, I went back to bed, sure that the fear of what my symptoms might mean would keep me awake. Instead, I passed back out soon after my head hit the pillow and didn’t wake up until late morning when my mother came in to check on me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as she saw the changes I’d noticed during the night, she pulled out her phone and immediately made an appointment with my pediatrician. When she described what I was experiencing to the person on the other end, they told her to bring me in as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You need to get up and dressed, Kyle. We need to leave right now.” She held up the phone. “I need to call your father.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head and begged her not to tell him about my condition. At least not until we knew what was wrong. She paused for a moment as she seemed to consider my request, then dialed his number anyway as she left the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I pushed myself out of bed, I realized the changes had progressed. Now the t-shirt hung extremely loose across my torso, and the arms poking out from the sleeves had lost a large portion of the muscles that had been there yesterday. I’d also lost another inch or two in height, making me look like I a kid playing dress-up in his father’s clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also noticed that my hair, which was usually cut in a short surfer style, much to my father’s continual annoyance, seemed thicker and longer. However, I forced my eyes away from the mirror and got dressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had to put on a shirt that I’d not worn since freshman year and cinch my belt as tight as it would go. The hems of the jeans were rolled up to accommodate for my decrease in stature, and I had to tighten my sneakers as tight as they would go just to keep them on my feet. Even still, I could feel them sliding around my smaller feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downstairs, I found my mother pacing back and forth, car keys in her hand. When she saw me, her mouth dropped open in surprise. She quickly recovered and ushered me toward the door. “Your father is going to meet us at the doctor’s office.” A look of sympathy slid across her features. “I don’t know if you’re hungry or not, but you probably shouldn’t eat before they can run some tests.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t bother to tell her that I had even less of an appetite than I had the night before. I should be ravenous, but the thought of eating made me nauseous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctor’s office was in one of large medical buildings housing at least a dozen different specialties. When Mom pulled into the parking lot, I spotted my father standing near the entrance. The look on his face when I climbed out and he saw me made me flinch. Clenching his jaw, he nodded toward the entrance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I followed him inside while Mom looked for a place to park and wait. Though I was positive she wanted to go in with us, I also knew that my father had told her that he’d handle it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As elevator took us to the fourth floor, he looked me up and down before grunting in what I was sure was displeasure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was a self-described “man’s man”. The kind of guy who felt that might always makes right, that being sick is for the weak and inferior, that men and women had their separate places in society, and the only things more important than guns, was a good after-dinner whiskey and football.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking time from work to accompany his son to the doctor obviously didn’t sit well with him. Nor, it would seem, did my symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inside the office waiting room, he gestured for me to check in while he took a seat near the television. I joined him and we sat in uncomfortable silence for ten minutes. When the nurse called my name, I felt a sense of relief to be away from him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing they did was take my vitals. Blood pressure, temperature, oxygen levels, and pulse were all within the normal range. When I climbed onto the scale, however, she looked at the readout, then to the chart in her hands, back to the readout again. She wrote down the number and gestured for me to stand next to a tape measure affixed to a nearby wall. Again, she did a slight double-take when she saw the results and compared them to what was on the file in her hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the examination room, she told me to strip down to my underwear and sit on the paper-covered table. Assuring me that the doctor would be in soon, she left. Being concerned and curious, I leaned over and flipped open the folder sitting nearby. In among all the data were two readings that made my blood chill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weight (lbs): Previous – 223. Current – 185.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Height (inches): Previous – 75. Current – 70.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the space of fifteen hours, I’d lost almost 40 pounds and five inches. My original worry, that I’d developed some aggressive form of cancer, melted away like ice cream in the summer. There was only one thing I knew of that could cause such drastic changes in such a short period of time. The thought of it being that made me feel like throwing up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few minutes later, Doctor Matthews came in. He paused and blinked several times as he took in my altered appearance, then moved over to look at the open file folder. After a few seconds, he turned back to me, mouth folded down into a frown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kyle, you might have probably guessed what’s wrong with you, but before you let yourself go too far down that particular rabbit hole, I want to run a few tests and make sure. Does that sound okay?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nodded, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He nodded in return and had his nurse come back to draw two vials of blood from my arm. Then he clapped his hand on my shoulder. “This shouldn’t take too long. At least not to rule out …” His fingers gave my shoulder a light squeeze. “Let’s just wait and see, okay?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He left the room, and the minutes ticked by slowly as I sat there alone. Though the exam room was chilly, my shivering was less tied to the temperature and more with trying not to freak out. If I didn’t have some crazy new form of cancer, which was what I was actually hoping, then the changes I was experiencing could only be A.C.R.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meaning my life as I’d known it was over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was somewhere between ten minutes and ten years before the door opened again. Doc Matthews, this time accompanied by my father, came in carrying a clipboard with pages and pages of printouts attached. My dad gave my shirtless chest the barest of glances before immediately looking away and taking up a spot right next to the table, arms crossed over his burly chest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc Matthews looked down at the clipboard for a moment, then looked up to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kyle, it seems it is just as we suspected. You’ve developed Acute Chromosomal Recombination Syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I could only stare blankly at the man who’d been responsible for overseeing my health for the last seventeen years. It wasn’t that I hadn’t heard him clearly. It was more that my brain simply refused to accept the forgone prognosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or the ramifications of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My non-response must have concerned him, because he reached out and put a hand on my shoulder. “You do understand what that means, right?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I nodded, swallowing the heavy lump stuck in my throat as I looked down at my hands resting in my lap. I couldn’t help but notice that they were thinner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yeah.” My voice sounded hollow, like I was talking from far outside myself. “I know what that means.” Those hands curled into painfully tight fists as I fought with everything in my power to keep the tears that threatened to come out at bay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It means I’m turning into a girl.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the worst storm we've seen in years and my boyfriend has been...distant. Maybe a few days trapped inside will be enough to figure out how to fix our relationship?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2140375-a-bunch-of-snowflakes/chapter/2140402/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Courtney&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Seriously Leo? What's gotten into you!?" I pleaded with him to say something but he just continued with his forced smile act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Oh y'know, just the storm. It has me worried because I won't be able to uh....go to the gym or whatever." Leo said unconvincingly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked at the lack of muscle mass on his arms. And while this is certainly the biggest storm we've seen in years, this has been a thing before the weather. These past few years he's just been so distant and I just...I want him to be okay. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Uh huh....right...well, look, since we are going to be stuck inside together... I'd really like to have a conversation about what's really going on with you because it's hurting our relationship." I said bluntly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leo looked at me like I just kicked a box of puppies into a volcano.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Court, I.... I'm sorry I didn't realize..." He started but I shushed him with a finger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Not now. I want you to really think about verbalizing what's actually going on with you. I won't be mad, I won't be upset, and I won't leave. I just want to help you hun. I want us to be okay but mostly I want to help you to get out of....whatever has you down lately. I'm going to go play some games for, let's say an hour but, when I'm back, we talk. Alright?" I smiled and kissed his cheek. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It looked like he was going to say something, but instead he just nodded and sighed. I turned on the tv, And I heard our bedroom door click behind me. Through the sound of Timmy and Tommy taking my bells, I swear I could hear Leo crying. I really hope this talk helps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athame is a priestess whose cum is intensely charged with divine energy. The Devouring Light is a goddess who has been sealed in a dungeon for hundreds of years. But when the two of them meet, Athame fails to keep herself from inflicting her brutal fantasies on the goddess, with permanent consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2126109-o-happy-dagger/chapter/2126112/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Meet Cute&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goddess knelt before Athame in the tent, blindfolded, wrists bound. The black fabric of the blindfold made a pretty contrast against &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; pale, white skin. The binding on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; wrists was a strip of the same fabric. It wouldn’t be difficult to escape. But the goddess hadn’t even &lt;i&gt;tried&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I don't understand why you're doing this…&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Her&lt;/span&gt; voice set off sparks in the priestess’s mind. The potential was there, but…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I knew you'd be weakened," Athame said. "I prepared myself for what would be necessary to return you to power. But I never could've imagined just how pathetic you've actually become." She grabbed &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; chin and tilted &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; head up to examine &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;, the claws of her gauntlet digging into divine flesh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goddess whimpered. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;fucking &lt;/i&gt;whimpered. Athame's blood boiled, and she slapped &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; across the face. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; shrieked in pain and surprise. The clawed gauntlet left bright red scratches across &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; face. They did not heal immediately. Not even enough divinity to heal a fucking cut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What's your name?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Left In A Hole To Die.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame struck &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; face again. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; yelped and started to softly cry, tears leaking out from behind the blindfold. “Wrong! You're &lt;i&gt;The Devouring Light&lt;/i&gt;! Say it!" She was being too harsh. She couldn't help it. The goddess’s whining brought out the worst in her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Th-The Devouring Light.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Now tell me your name."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pathetic Whimpering Bitch.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" The words were the right words, but the meaning changed somewhere between the ears and the brain. Divine names went deeper than words. The fact that &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; name had changed that quickly was a bad sign; &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; had little enough divine presence that Athame’s thoughts were having a measurable impact on &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;&lt;i&gt;she &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt;. It wasn’t what Athame wanted, not really, but…it did excite her. &lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I’m sorry, I’m sorry…&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame growled in frustration and the goddess flinched. "It's not your fault," she said through bared teeth. It didn't sound reassuring. "You didn't choose this."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;It's my fault. I chose this.&lt;/span&gt;” Tears slid down &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; face over the red welt where &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;'d been hit. Athame clenched her fists. Was &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; just being contrary? Did &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt; to get hit again? Or was &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; just unconsciously mirroring Athame’s desires?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You're barely even here. You're barely even a person right now." Athame wasn't sure whose benefit she said it for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I'm not a person right now.&lt;/span&gt;" The way &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; said it practically made Athame lose control. That golden voice, tickling down her spine, making her cock twitch. She was on the edge of losing it anyway just looking at &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;. Pale skin, untouched by the sun for hundreds of years. Full, heavy breasts. Wide, beautiful hips. Long, golden hair. A tall pair of slightly-curving bone-white horns. The body of divinity. Athame had prepared herself to serve a goddess as blinding as the sun, to feed &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; insatiable appetites, and had found &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, maybe it wasn't a total loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Let's get you fixed up. Open your mouth."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goddess obeyed, opening wide and sticking out &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; tongue as though &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; knew exactly what Athame wanted. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; probably did. Athame took a gold ring out of her pocket and put it on the goddess’s tongue. “Get this nice and wet for me.” As &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; rolled it around inside &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; mouth, Athame slipped her leggings down around her ankles, pulled her dress up, and took out her dick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Open.” &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; did, presenting the wet ring on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; tongue. Drool dripped from &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; open mouth to the floor. Athame took the ring and slid it down her cock to fit snugly at the base. The goddess shuffled forward on &lt;b&gt;her &lt;/b&gt;knees, homing in on cock despite the blindfold. When &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; got close enough on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; own, Athame put a gauntleted hand on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; face and held &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You know what this is?" Athame smacked her slowly hardening cock against &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; cheek.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Uh-huh…&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; tried to turn toward it, probing with &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; tongue, but Athame held &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; head in position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You want it?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Please…Give it to me…I need it…&lt;/span&gt;" &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt;‘d retained that much at least. Once upon a time, Athame would have been risking her life playing this game with &lt;i&gt;The Devouring Light&lt;/i&gt;. But she wasn’t too worried about &lt;i&gt;Pathetic Whimpering Bitch&lt;/i&gt; draining her life force out through her dick. "&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Athame, please!&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame grabbed a horn and yanked &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; off the floor by it. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; screamed, a sound like silver bells being tortured. "You haven't earned the right to call me that!" In fact, &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; hadn't even been told that name, and the inconsistency irritated Athame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Sorry! I'm Sorry! Mi-mistress! Mistress!&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Better." She let go and the goddess dropped back onto &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; knees with a pained squeak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Please mistress, your cock...&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you want it so much, force me to give it to you. A goddess should be able to do that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time Athame felt it: the psychic tendrils of &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; divine influence, so familiar, yet distinct from what she’d experienced before. But they should have wrapped around her, cracked her like an egg, wormed into every inch of her soul and made her into the goddess's instrument. Instead, they weakly prodded her. Athame didn't even have to steel herself to resist, the feeling just made her dick harder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Is that it? Is this what &lt;i&gt;The Devouring Light &lt;/i&gt;has been reduced to?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Please... give me…&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t deserve it.” The goddess made a hungry, whimpering sound and pressed &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; face harder into the steel gauntlet, straining toward Athame’s cock. It must’ve hurt, but &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; need was that great. “But you &lt;i&gt;tried&lt;/i&gt;, so I’ll give it to you anyway.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She grabbed the bitch by the horns and jammed her cock into &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; mouth. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; moaned in pleasure around it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re not a goddess anymore; you’re just a fucktoy.” Athame punctuated her words by thrusting into the goddess’s mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Mmbm—ahagah—Mmbm—uhhck&lt;/span&gt;” An attempt at speech, as though there was any point in repeating what &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; was told.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s that? I can’t hear you with your slutty mouth stuffed full of dick.” She rammed it in as deep as she could go, pressing the goddess’s lips against her cock ring. “Try it again.” She desperately wanted to choke &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; with her dick, but she didn’t know if that was actually possible. The goddess clearly had no gag reflex and Athame wasn’t sure if &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; even really needed to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Aahhhgnnn…&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s okay if you can’t say it. Fucktoys don’t need to talk.” Athame resumed fucking the goddess’s face. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I’m just a fucktoy.&lt;/span&gt; Barely perceptible words entered Athame’s mind. She pulled her cock out and slapped the goddess again. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Her&lt;/span&gt; shriek of pain filled the tent. “Did you not hear me? Fucktoys &lt;i&gt;don’t need to talk&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Yes, mistress. I-I’m sorry, mistress. This stupid fucktoy gets confused.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Good girl.” Athame said. Then, she added as an afterthought, “I am proud of you, though; that you’re able to do that.” The praise made the goddess practically radiate with pleasure. “Just wait until I &lt;i&gt;tell you to&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goddess didn’t respond, just opened &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; mouth again. Athame smiled and slid her dick back inside. The goddess rolled &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; tongue around her cock, savoring it, licked firmly from base to shaft, then took it as far as it would go, &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; nose against Athame’s pelvis. “Fuck,” Athame groaned, her gauntleted hands loosely holding the goddess’s head, tangled in &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; hair. Encouraged, the goddess did it again, faster, and Athame’s breathing started to grow ragged, her grip tightening. Before &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; could do it a third time, the priestess was unable to wait any longer. She grabbed the goddess’s horns and used them as handles to better take control and fuck &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; throat. The goddess let out a muffled moan of pleasure as Athame rammed into &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; over and over again. Suddenly she felt her orgasm approaching, quicker than she’d expected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here it comes,” Athame groaned. Two more thrusts and pleasure overtook her, exploding from her cock and radiating through her body. She continued thrusting jerkily, losing track of everything else for a moment, then, panting, she slowed and stopped. She pushed her raven-black hair away from her face and looked down. Her breath caught in her throat. The goddess’s lips were still wrapped around her. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; was flushed with exertion and breathing hard, streaks of tears still visible on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; cheeks. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Her&lt;/span&gt; blindfold had come askew. One eye the color of sunlight looked up at Athame, glowing with an internal light, with an expression of absolute devotion. “Beautiful,” the priestess breathed, and ran her fingers through &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; hair, tucking a lock behind &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; ear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame pulled out with a groan. The goddess’s expression didn’t change, panting open-mouthed with &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her &lt;/span&gt;tongue hanging out, staring at &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; priestess, lost in eyes as dark and deep as &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;hers &lt;/span&gt;were bright. A small amount of sparkling white liquid dripped onto the floor of the tent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You—!” Athame dropped to her knees with a thud and forced the goddess’s mouth closed so quickly &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; teeth clicked together and &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; squeaked in surprise. “Swallow it, you stupid cunt! Don’t just let it drip all over the fucking &lt;i&gt;ground!&lt;/i&gt;” Eye wide and startled, the goddess swallowed. Athame let go of &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; chin and looked at the droplets on the ground, which had already started to lose their sparkle and go clear. “What are you waiting for?” she demanded. “Lick it up!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goddess started to lower &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;herself&lt;/span&gt; down, but it wasn’t fast enough. Athame forced &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; head to the ground, practically rubbing &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; nose in it like a dog. The goddess &lt;i&gt;finally &lt;/i&gt;seemed to understand the urgency and desperately did as &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; was told. Athame let her go and sat backward with a sigh. The goddess kept licking the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s enough,” Athame said, irritated. So much for the fucking afterglow. The goddess stopped and got back up on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; knees. &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;She&lt;/span&gt; opened &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; mouth to show that &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;’d swallowed it all. “Fix your blindfold.” The goddess wordlessly complied. The welt and scratches on &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; cheek started to heal, at least, so &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt;’d gotten &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame pulled the ring off her dick, then leaned forward and untied the ropes around the goddess’s wrists. “I’ve got things to do. Stay in here. As long as you’re alone, you can take off your blindfold. Sleep on the cot if you get tired.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Yes, mistress. Thank you, mistress.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame pulled herself together, straightened her clothes, started to leave, then paused at the tent flap. “I’m sorry about…” The sentence dangled, as though she couldn’t decide which particular thing to apologize for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I forgive you.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame bit her tongue so hard she tasted blood, and left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="text-align:center"&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame didn’t come back until hours later. The goddess’s state meant that plans needed to change and decisions needed to be made. She still didn’t know what she was going to tell her benefactors in Evelynd. Obviously not the truth; not yet, at least. Not until she had no other option. But they’d need to be told &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she returned to the tent, the goddess was asleep in the cot, still wearing the blindfold. Athame tossed spare bedding onto the floor on the other side of the tent, and changed into her nightgown. There was only one cot because she hadn’t thought that the goddess would need one. When she went into that dungeon she’d expected to find something transcendent, not a &lt;i&gt;person&lt;/i&gt;. She laid down in her nest and tried to go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, sleep was not forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’d worked for this for years, and then once the time had come, she’d lost control of herself &lt;i&gt;again&lt;/i&gt;. Right back into her &lt;i&gt;predilections&lt;/i&gt; as though she’d never stopped. She’d treated &lt;i&gt;The Devouring Light&lt;/i&gt;, the goddess whom she’d devoted herself to resurrecting, as a fucking &lt;i&gt;cocksleeve&lt;/i&gt;. Her cheeks burned and her eyes watered as she remembered what she’d called &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;, how she’d struck &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; without thinking. What’s worse, each time the goddess had displayed an ounce of divine power, Athame had &lt;i&gt;punished &lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;; as though that weren’t the &lt;i&gt;whole fucking point&lt;/i&gt; of the entire exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t her first time doing this; lying wakeful in bed and wallowing in shame. But it was so much &lt;i&gt;harder &lt;/i&gt;to push through now that she was so damn &lt;i&gt;weepy&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goddess stirred and Athame froze, tears leaking out of her eyes. She didn’t want &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; to see her like this. Especially not &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt;. If &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; saw, then &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; would know that Athame wasn’t fit to be &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; priestess, that she didn’t deserve to lead &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; church. Footsteps padded toward her. Her heart thudded in her chest as she felt the goddess lie down beside her. Warm, soft skin pressed into her back and gentle hands wrapped around her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;Mistress,&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;she&lt;/span&gt; murmured sleepily. “&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;It’s okay.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame made a strangled noise, somewhere between a snarl and a sob. &lt;i&gt;I don’t want this!&lt;/i&gt; she desperately thought at the goddess. &lt;i&gt;I don’t want your comfort!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;It’s okay,&lt;/span&gt;” the goddess repeated, “&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I liked it. You did good.&lt;/span&gt;” Athame felt &lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;her&lt;/span&gt; softly kiss her hair. “&lt;span style="color:#ff9900"&gt;I like you. You’ll take care of me. Even though…I forgot about…&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athame waited to hear what the goddess had forgotten, but all she heard was slow breathing. Eventually she realized the goddess had fallen asleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She stopped crying. Soon, she fell asleep, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;August 5th;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth, a girl from California, and Glix, an AI, are scheduled for a tennis match in an amateur tournament.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will happen when the AI ends up charming and Amaranth develop feelings?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2125284-an-epic-battle/chapter/2125294/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Oneshot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 5th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amaranth right?” called a voice, startling her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes! And you’re… Glax?” she said, turning to face the newcomer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Glix. They/Them, you?” the voice, &lt;em&gt;Glix, &lt;/em&gt;said, chuckling, their voice was high and clear, contrasting with their masculine leaning appearance, with so many piercings it made her heart skip a beat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She/her, thanks,” Amaranth smiled, she was taller than her opponent, she would estimate their height at around one hundred and seventy centimetres, or around five feet, seven inches, as some people here in California still use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here in California. &lt;/em&gt;She thought. She shook her head as she remembered she was just in a VR environment made to look like California. With the state of her legs, it was the only way for her to play her favourite sport, tennis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Earth to Amaranth?” that same high voice called, giggling, once again startling her, she jumped and let out a little &lt;em&gt;EEP!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes! I’m here, where’s our referee?” she asked, still flustered by the person (enby?) in front of her, their avatar was beautiful, if a bit androgynous. Their hair was multicoloured, it looked like it sparkled in the sun. Their face was angular with soft cheeks and not a hint of facial hair. She was trying to keep her bisexual ass from falling in love five minutes after meeting them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am here,” called a second voice, “Galem, Zir/Zem, Welcome to my court!” zir announced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First set: 4-3, 40-30, Amaranth serves. &lt;/em&gt;Read the holographic panel beside the referee. It was just a match for a VR amateur tournament, it was not important; however, it didn’t matter to Amaranth, she was as focused on her opponent as it is possible. &lt;em&gt;They look very laid-back&lt;/em&gt; she thought, looking at Glix, as beads of sweat dropped on the polymer of the field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She breathed, slipped back in the zone, and served a fastball, right in front of them, the ball zoomed past Glix, whose smile dropped for a second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Game, Amaranth.” announced the referee, allowing her to breathe once again. It was a hard match, her opponent looked easy-going, but the exchanges were long and tiring. And they made very few mistakes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of their errors, though, looked weird, as if they purposely sent the ball slightly out of the court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey! Glix!” Amaranth called, for the first time in the match. “What’s your deal, you’re not playing at your best I can see that you know!” she finished, frustrated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix smirked, “Sorry Amaranth, but I can’t play with the best of my abilities right now, if I let myself lose I would obliterate you before you’d have time to realise it,”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy blinked, “What? Why! Are you a pro?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The enby frowned for a second before giving a sly smile, “No, I just can increase the speed of my reflexes and reaction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tall blond girl sighed, “You’re one of them right? The new AIs the news are talking about? What are you doing playing tennis instead of breaking the stock exchange!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At that, her opponent laughed, “You do know the stock exchange hasn’t existed in a century right? Are you a history nerd? How cute!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth blushed, “I’m a PhD student in history yes, specialised in pre-union history, and older AIs make my job as a historian a &lt;em&gt;nightmare! &lt;/em&gt;Do you have any idea how hard studying the early twenty-first century is when they had that weird phase with Generative AIs? It was two decade of slop! Y’all make my job, so, &lt;em&gt;so, &lt;/em&gt;difficult.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The enby was still laughing, ignoring the attempt by the referee of forcing them to start their serve, and the game. “Please don’t compare me to these honey! I’m completely different, and ya know, &lt;em&gt;actually sentient&lt;/em&gt;. You should poke a comp sci student about it.” they finished, grinning widely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She rolled her eyes, “Whatever, serve! I’m going to win this match fair and square.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Galem sighed, &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First set: 3-5, 15-40, set point; Glix serves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth let out the highest pitched noise she could as she sent the ball back to Glix. The exchange for the set point had been more than hard, and she could feel the lactic acid filling her muscle, at least the &lt;em&gt;simulated &lt;/em&gt;lactic acid. Glix was as laid back as ever, they even kept trying to banter, only to be met by utter silence. She was focused, she was going to &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt;. It was all that mattered, she couldn’t do it IRL, so she would do it here, and she would burn those funny feelings about her opponent, they were an AI! She couldn’t catch feelings for a freaking AI!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix pulled a short ball falling just on her side of the net, a shot of adrenaline entered her bloodstream and she jumped to intercept the ball before it stopped. She managed to send another fastball right behind them, that was it, the set was &lt;em&gt;hers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Against all odds Glix jumped and sent the ball back her way, it was a perfect recovery and Amy couldn’t help but being impressed by their talents. They might be an AI, but they were legitimately good at tennis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That was a good one babe,” Glix smiled, one more attempt to banter to destabilise her. She wouldn’t let them! She smashed the ball as hard as she could right into their blind spot. Amy looked at the ball as if it were in slow motion, her opponent did try to react, but it was too late, the ball touched the polymer right on the line. &lt;em&gt;There, set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;Set, Amaranth.&lt;em&gt;” &lt;/em&gt;the referee announced calmly; prompting her to take a deep breath, half of the job done, she just needed to repeat this one more time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Good job, Amaranth.” Glix cheered in their annoyingly attractive high melodious voice. “Wanna talk while we drink? Gotta stay hydrated girl.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth stared in fury, squeezing her electrolyte solution, as sweat slowly dropped to the floor. Her stare, however, was met by a charming smirk, and she blushed again, she put her bottle in her mouth to avoid embarrassing herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix put her hands up in defence. “I’m just trying to be friendly girl, just that I promise, it’s not a plot to secretly throw you off or something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix chuckled, “Did you miss the moment where I told you I could destroy you if I wanted to? I don’t want to cheat, I don’t need to, I just want to play tennis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh.” &lt;em&gt;Oh, indeed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The enby laughed again, they seem to do that a lot, “Come then, we have five minutes to exchange details about our lives before the second set.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy shrugged, and followed them to the bench.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So, a PhD student in pre-union history, huh?” Glix said between gulps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy grinned, she loved talking about her work, it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;her passion after all, and the AI seemed nice, she was still weary about talking to them, even if they did feel sentient. “Yes! I started last year, in the University of Southern California. Focusing on the first half of the twenty-first century.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix smiled back, “I have a buddy who’s finishing his master’s degree in that uni, which campus are you in?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy tilted her head, thinking, “An AI? Can’t you download the internet? Why would you need to go to university, isn’t that a bit… unfair to the other students?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The enby laughed, “Girl, you can’t just download the internet, even if you could, it would be like learning everything by heart, your job is more than purely learning dates and stuff right?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth seemed confused but continued, “I guess so,”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He’s focusing on post-union history, from the early 40sonwards. He’s in the LA campus.” their voice adopting a valley girl kind of tone and a pleasant sing-song quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tennis woman blushed, she could get used to that voice, “I’m also in LA. Though I live to the north of the city, thankfully when the world calmed the hell down they thought about developing the train network” she giggled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I like your giggle,” Glix said with a sparkle in their eyes, their eyes were beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And I like your voice,” Amy said in a dreamy tone, before coughing as she realised how that sounded, “Anyway, how does it work, you created your voice? I don’t know how AIs work nowadays” she finished, blushing from embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your blush is adorable, Amaranth,” they added, with a little giggle, “And I don’t know how it works either? I’m not a computer scientist, I’m actually an English literature professor for high school students in New Paris.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth was not only confused, she was also disarmed, she expected to not like them, but they ended up being charming. Amy shook her head trying to regain her composure, only for more feelings invading her head. She couldn’t help how fast she developed crushes, she would try to crush the feeling when she would crush them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s time,” the referee called.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Set, 5-3, 40-30, set point, Glix Serves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth was breathing heavily, the AI was dominating in the second set, and she found herself defending against a set point. They had exchanged a lot of banter now that she knew it wasn’t a plot by her opponent to mess with her, it turned out they were lovely and genuinely funny. She was already fighting a crush on the enby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her strategy did not pay in the second set, she won the first set by exploiting her opponent’s laid back attitude to drop precise balls in their blind spots. Unfortunately for Amy, Glix was way more cautious in the second set, combined with her aggressive play, her opponent now had the upper hand, and it looked like she would lose the second set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She took a big breath and focused, just in time to send back the ball into Glix’s court with a grunt. The long and hard exchanges were beginning to tire Amy out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What love, starting to get tired?” Glix smirked, she returned the smirk but did not bother to answer, she was too focused on the ball. Their attitude still laid back, even if they were paying attention to avoid errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Hah!” &lt;/em&gt;Amaranth screamed as she barely sent the smash ball right to her opponent. Unfortunately for her, they were already at the net to send a short ball just barely in her side of the court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She tried to run and run to pick out the ball, the moment again started to show up in slow motion, the ball was falling, Amy tried to push her muscles — virtual as they were — to the maximum. In what felt like an hour, but more likely was a few seconds, the ball slowly dropped until it collided with the polymer of the court and bounced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth smiled, it was high enough for her to smash the ball as hard as she could, to end up… Right into the net. A tear slowly dripped from her eyes, mixing with the sweat, before finishing on the ground. She had lost the set. They were equals now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Set! Glix!” The referee — she forgot zir name — yelled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy was on the ground, gulping air with hunger, she tried to internalise she lost the set, and more importantly she would have to fight another long hard set to finish the match. She looked at her opponent who was also breathing heavily. They were about ten centimetres shorter, but their legs looked like they were the same length as theirs, which was probably normal. Even if she had an easy transition, her proportion were always slightly off by cis female standards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix arrived at her side and smiled broadly, offering a hand. Amaranth took it and smiled too, they had about ten minutes to drink and talk again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Good set, Glix,” she smiled, offering a hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thanks, it was hard, you’re a formidable opponent.” Glix smirked shaking her hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They sat on the bench and started talking about everything but tennis, their conversation took them from history to mathematics, society, past and future, and the whole time Glix was flirting with her. She wasn’t dumb, she knew it was flirting, which meant her growing crush wasn’t one-sided.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She found herself flirting back, it was nice to receive attention from someone, she spent most of her childhood being bullied or picked on. And she was never exactly &lt;em&gt;popular &lt;/em&gt;in high school and university, even if she had some partners who lasted a few months in the past five years of higher education. The attention was thus welcomed, and she found herself drowning in the sight of their hair. Or their face, or everything else, they definitely spent a lot of time carefully crafting their avatar – would Glix look like this in real life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You mentioned you were teaching, do you have a body out there?” she asked, after almost ten minutes of flirting back and forth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix smiled, “No, my android body isn’t ready yet, I heard the hair is causing issues to the engineers,” they giggled. “I’m teaching by holograms, it works quite well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh. You mean you’ll look like that IRL?” Amy asked nervously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was Glix’s turn to tilt their head, “Yeah of course, why?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s awfully distracting…” Amaranth blushed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix smirked and resumed flirting with her, until the referee called, it was time for the third and final set.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third Set, 5-3, 30-0, Amaranth serves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth was breathing heavily, it was &lt;em&gt;hard, &lt;/em&gt;but she was smiling widely, her opponent was very charming, and smart, and she was starting to give up on fighting her crush. She sighed lightly as she sent the ball as hard as she could. Like almost every time Glix was there to send it back into Amy’s court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contrary to the last set, she was playing more safely, less aggressively, and it was paying, she found herself dominating in the final set. Her opponent also was doing more errors as well, but she could tell it was by fatigue rather than deliberately. Amy wouldn’t content herself with an easy win, she was there to &lt;em&gt;fight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They smiled and bantered together as they exchanged the ball, she was starting to plan, if she won — and it looked like she would — she would ask Glix on a date. She knew she was weary of them at first, but they grew up on her, and she definitely wanted to know them better in a more… Relaxed environment. So she sent the ball back, hard, and kept smiling. She would win, and win their heart as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last, the ball bounced on the court and passed over Glix’s shoulder, &lt;em&gt;There, point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Point! Amaranth,”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That was good Amaranth, match point now.” Glix smirked, which sent a flutter in Amy’s simulated stomach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thanks!” she grinned, just one more point and she’d win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following exchange was long, and tiring, each time Amy sent the ball, her opponent was there. She was purely focused on the ball, not even listening to Glix’s words. All her energy was on sending the ball back, sometimes a fastball, sometimes barely passing the net, at random, but Glix seemed to be able to predict her move, and for all she knew, they were.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, Amaranth sent a slow ball which bounced on the net, once again the moment seemed to last hours as Amy watched the ball, would it pass on the other side — signifying her success — or would it drop on her side of the court?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ball had enough momentum — if barely — to drop on the enby’s side, she could see them try to smash it, they really did. And they managed it; but the ball spun in the sky and dropped again; on their side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy sighed, she’d done it, she won.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Game, Set, Match, Amaranth!” the referee called, as the holographic panel showed her name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amaranth collapsed, just in time for Glix to catch her. They pulled Amy in a hug and smiled. “Congratulations Amaranth! That was the best match ever! We totally need a rematch one of these days.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy smiled and cuddled a bit to Glix’s lean frame, she looked into their green eyes, and sighed happily, she glanced at the holographic window she had in front of her and grinned, just what she needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey Glix! I won two tickets for Roland Garros next year!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh that’s rad, VIP?” Glix smiled, looking into Amy’s vast blue eyes and their hand in her blond hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yea!” &lt;em&gt;They didn’t get it&lt;/em&gt; she thought. “Wanna come with me?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh, sure! I should have an android body IRL before that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They still didn’t get it. &lt;/em&gt;“I meant, as a date. I want to learn to know you better…” Amy blushed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glix was suddenly blushing too “Sure! But it’s next year?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is yes.” Amy said, cocking her head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then would you go on a date with me next weekend? I know a great café.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy turned crimson but nodded, “I would love to,”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wi_authornotes"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div class="p-avatar-wrap"&gt;&lt;a class="avatar has-link" href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/"&gt;&lt;img id="acc_ava_change profile" alt="" src="https://cdn.scribblehub.com/avatar/s/12/ava_49937_1754725072.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="an_username"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scribblehub.com/profile/49937/coco33920/"&gt;coco33920&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="wi_authornotes_body"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hey!

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Briar and Lily. Doggirl mech pilot and catgirl cyborg assassin, clones and sisters, have been separated for thirteen years since the death of their "mother" Tulip. Thirteen years of a longing neither wants to admit to.&lt;br /&gt; But now, finally at 23, they're stationed at the same city . . . a chance to reconnect in person .  . . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as the world starts to go to shit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Siscest cyberpunk mechsploitation with Kaiju and a mild apocalypse)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2116689-wildflowers-of-ruin/chapter/2116691/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Ruin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;POV: Cerberus - Briar Vix (she/it) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I hate the taste of granola. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;The dull sweetness, as the dry flakes and crumbles of grain cut at my mouth and dampen in battleworn drool . . . I wish I had any jerky left . . . but it eases the pains in my stomach all the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;So I pulled another bar from my jacket’s leather pocket. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;So I shove down another bite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;As with a groaning twist of overheating hydraulics, and a static pinch of the neural link in my neck, I shove another Illrhyian’s hulking fish-like head into a wall of solid concrete and spite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Smearing a painting of dripping cerulean and cloud-pale scales, like the sky of Terra . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Like her eyes.} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;It thinks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I ignore its thoughts, pushing them to the back of our mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt; is not the time. Even in a mech as reinforced and high tech as HECATE, I'm only running at half capacity; And the flickering red LEDs reflecting in my dull blue eyes, and beeping alarms burning my dropping ears, won't let me forget. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;We’re running out of time. More shapes, as large as my spindly chassis or larger, crawl and lumber over the remains of the outer wall and the silent urban sector around me. We’re spread too thin . . . It's only u– only me here. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;And the foul scent of copper and ammonia burns just beyond my intake filters . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;The fish faced-spawn of this mudball. . .  fucking aquatic pieces of evolutionary shi—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;&amp;lt;And one of them is charging right at us. Please dodge.&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Breath growls between my fangs, crackled lip stinging, as I wrench the controls to the side. Narrowly avoiding the cracking of a sensuous tail, finely scraping the dark paint off HECATE’s side. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;It stings all the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Leaping forward, my steel body springs with the hydraulic lurch of her insectoid legs. Dark talons sinking into soft blue flesh. Ripping and tearing as their meat scatters to pulp across the street.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I scream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Corpses fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Guts and heads dance under my clawed hands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Metal groans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Something hits me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Something around my coiled form snaps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I stumble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Its claws pierce through the plating of HECATE’s chest, wires alight with blistering pain, as my jaw tenses in shock. Sensors blaring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;As coolant and hydraulics drips onto the battlefield . . . and into the cockpit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Soaking my once branded tanktop in black oil  . . . as it mixes with the pooling red. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Shit. Shit. Shit.} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Our breath quickens as our hand traces the ivory claw.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;&amp;lt;Breathe. We will be okay.&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Breathe in. Breathe out. Look out the sensors . . . heaving stuttering movements . . . slowing . . .  it's dying at least. &lt;em&gt;WE.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;ARE NOT. OKAY. FUCK.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[-rberus.]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt; I catch over the comms. My ears flicker. She sounds . . . oddly panicked . . . usually Handlers are colder. She didn't care about thi— &lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;[This is Cheshire. I’m on my way to your location. Are you alive?]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Not Handler?}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Not one of the Handlers. That name . .  its familiar. But thinking . . . is hard. I can barely stumble against the wall . . . as we slide against an Illrhyian’s corpse. Half dismembered arm . . . still stuck through us. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Almost eroritc. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Yes . . .]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt; Is all I can sputter, as things grow dim on the edges . . . the red lights reflecting, my hungered face in the shattered glass in front of me. A mess of tangled brown hair, freckles, and a weary distance some would call "psychologically concerning”. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Cracks are pale and growing. Evening air . . . leaks in with the fettered scent of distant ash and decaying xeno. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;It's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;almost &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;satisfying. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I would laugh if that didn't hurt like fuck . . . even if I wasn't hopped up on all the stimulants and pain meds coursing through my engineered caniform flesh.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I'd been stabbed before . . . this one didn’t look good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Help is coming . . . }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt; Is all the weak one said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I don’t have the heart . . . or blood flow, to argue with it. Everything is growing dim and dull . . . I can barely hold onto the controls. At least I did a good job. The sector is safe. Good Hound . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I’ve made it longer than mo—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[You promised.]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt; The words cut through, clear and cold, worry and spite mix an equal measure as the comm system fizzes out. The reactor shutting offline, lights blinking out, as the coolant drains away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I must be dreaming . . . because beyond the dark glass panes are a silhouette. A woman. Metal softly tinking and scraping, she clambers up HECATE’s punctured side. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Metal whines. Glass shatters. As pale chrome claws glint in the amber sunset. Eyes flickering softly, every shade of the falling rain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;And a smile, sharp and thin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Hungry and pained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Danger}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I try to move.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Twist my body. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;. . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I lay slack in my seat, pinned by the claw piercing my gut. Sharp fingers trace my blood specked cheek, oddly warm. Her cybernetics pulsate the same extent as her eyes, as her grip loops around the claw . . . and cracks it. Falling apart . . . as she holds something over my torn flesh. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;“Briar . . . I’m here.” Her eyes are different . . so much is different . . . she definitely got taller . . . but that wide and worried smile . . . it's still the same. “I’m here for you little sis. I’ll get you out of here. I— I—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;“I missed you Lily.” The worlds fall out of our lips with a tumblr of thirteen years of emotions, as somehow Lily and I lurch forward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Falling out of the cockpit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;The neural link rips . . . and I go slack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Tumbling onto a patch of grass and wildflowers . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Lying on top of her, looking into her eyes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Both of us panting . . . I’m definitely about to pass out . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;Lily's face . . . looks like mine, tech interweaves hers where mine holds scars, and pointed cat-like ears where mine are a hound’s. But the same nose. The same freckles. The same lips. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;{Thirteen years.}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;She smells like blood, lemon, and apricots . . .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;&amp;lt;The same lips&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:400"&gt;I kiss her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lights. Camera. Deception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When struggling and burdened by debt, Sameer " Sam" agrees to impersonate his missing twin sister-rising actress Sameera-just for one night, he expects an awkward evening in a dress and heels. Instead, he's pulled into a glamorous but dangerous world of secrets, scandals, and high-stakes cinema. As the "one-night act" stretches into days and then weeks, Sam must protect his sister's career, outwit suspicious producers, and survive the growing attention of film industry men. But the deeper he slips into her role, the harder it becomes to remember where Sameera ends... and Sam begins.&lt;br /&gt; As the lies get bigger and the stakes get deadlier, Sam must fight to keep the truth hidden... even from himself. Because the deeper he sinks into the role of the replacement heroine, the more he begins to lose the boundary between Sameer and Sameera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A story full of glamour, feminization, mystery, and the intoxicating danger of stolen identities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2116312-the-replacement-heroine/chapter/2116314/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I waited silently as the team of women circled around me like a well-practiced storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingers tugged at my hair from behind while someone else brushed a warm foundation sponge across my jaw. Another woman worked on my nails in patient, rhythmic strokes. The room smelled faintly of hairspray, rose-scented lotion, and the sharp tang of acetone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I kept my eyes shut-partly to avoid the mirror, partly because the closeness of it all overwhelmed me. Their hands moved with the confidence of people sculpting a familiar statue... except the statue was me, and the shape they were carving didn't belong to me at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A comb tugged at my scalp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cool brush feathered across my eyelids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Warm breath grazed my cheek as someone leaned in to check the blending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tickle of brow-threading snapped sharply through my skin-tiny stings like a row of ants biting in sequence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I clenched my hands in my lap, trying not to react.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Alright, dear," a soft, patronising voice cooed. "You can open your eyes now."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I inhaled and lifted my lids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The image in the mirror left me wonder struck.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My skin was smooth-unnaturally smooth-like polished porcelain. My cheekbones looked sculpted, my lips fuller, tinted a soft pink that didn't belong to any version of me I had ever met. My lashes were long enough to cast shadows on my cheeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was no longer the 23 year old nerdy guy that I had been before tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A stunning woman stared back at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My twin sister Sameera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Perfect," Jyotsna murmured, her eyes practically shining. "You look exactly like Sameera. No one will ever guess."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My throat tightened. I knew she was wrong, hoped she was wrong because I could still see fragments of myself under the work-and I did not want to get lost in her. But yes, ... I resembled her .. very closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jyotsna didn't give me time to breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Jewellery next," she said, lifting a velvet tray. "Hold still."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cold metal brushed my collarbone as she fitted the diamond necklace around my throat. It felt strange-light yet present, like a leash made of starlight. Her fingers brushed my skin again as she clipped on the earrings. They pinched slightly but thankfully my ears did not ned to be pierced .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There we go," she hummed. "Just beautiful."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then came the dress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gown's fabric whispered against my body as they guided me into it-light green, shimmering, studded with Swarovski crystals. The diagonal cut hugged my waist too tightly. The padded, glued-on cleavage pressed against my chest with an unnatural weight, warm and slightly sticky where it adhered to my freshly waxed skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Standing was a task. The green heels felt like thin stilts strapped to my feet, forcing my posture to tilt forward, hips pushed out, steps short and delicate. My calves trembled with each adjustment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jyotsna stepped back, admiring her work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There," she said softly. "Sameera, reborn."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sameera, reborn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only for a night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked like her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I needed to move like her. It was part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything about me looked smooth, delicate... feminine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything except the panic swirling inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A knock sounded before I could gather myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then Aarav stepped in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aarav Mehrotra-Sameera's husband, my brother-in-law, celebrated producer-director, golden boy of the film industry, and the man whose life was currently falling apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His eyes widened as soon as he saw me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Wow," he exhaled dramatically. "For a moment, I thought Sameera had walked back through that door."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He extended his hand toward me with theatrical flourish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Come, gorgeous wifey. Your carriage awaits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes at the word *wifey*, but took his hand anyway-because walking in heels was like learning a new alphabet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's a dumb plan, Aarav," I muttered as he helped steady me. "Someone is going to find out the truth and embarrass us both. Anyway, you already paid me half."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"And you'll get the remaining fifty percent," he said lightly, "if you make it through the night."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He grinned. The kind of grin only a director who has convinced an actor to perform a dangerous stunt can manage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Just follow the plan."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ah yes. *The plan.*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disaster that had led to this moment had begun nearly six weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sameera-my twin sister, rising starlet-had vanished overnight. Left a message saying she was tired of the industry and was going away into obscurity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Problem one: she'd signed several movies and collected signing amounts. Producers were furious for dates &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Problem two: Aarav had launched a massive big-budget film with her as the star. Financiers wanted shooting to begin or their money back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So he hired detectives to search for Sameera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then he came to me-with a ridiculous proposal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tonight, Swarga Productions was hosting a massive industry party. Everyone who mattered would be there. Everyone who could destroy Aarav's career and demand their money back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And to buy time... they needed to see Sameera.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hence, ten lakhs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half before, half after.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And here I was-walking clumsily on heels, clutching a sparkly green purse, every step a prayer to gravity-towards the waiting car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aarav opened the door like a perfect gentleman and offered a hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Come, dear."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I rolled my eyes but didn't say anything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doubt twisted deep in my stomach-an unsettling, growing dread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was this a big mistake ?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had a sinking suspicion... yes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copyright Notice &amp;amp; Disclaimer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; © Moon Winters, 2025.

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe with You:&lt;br /&gt;    Back Home, Back to You&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;                                                                                                                  back-cover blurb&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Jamie Hayes left California and his best friend Lena behind. Four years in Chicago taught Jamie one thing: some kinds of lonely don't have a cure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But California does. California has sun that doesn't feel suffocating. California has Lena Vance next door—best friend, fierce protector, the only person who's ever made Jamie feel safe. California has magical girl anime, League of Legends at 2 AM, and a Squad that might just have room for one more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie's been wearing a costume that doesn't fit for as long as they can remember. Coming home might be the first step toward finding out what happens when she finally takes it off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current temporary cover was created by myself with a locally ran build of SD generating the base model which was finished manually using PS and IF on a drawing tablet.&lt;br /&gt; Artists are currently being commissioned to create art based on this setting which eventually includes a book cover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2113852-safe-with-you-back-home-back-to-you/chapter/2113917/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter 1: The Missing Piece&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chapter 1: “The Missing Piece”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;July, 2014&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The California sun felt different than the sun in Chicago. In Chicago, the heat felt oppressive, like it was trying to trap you in the concrete. Here, as the Hayes family SUV finally turned onto the familiar pavement of the cul-de-sac, the heat felt like a blanket. It was golden and heavy, but for the first time in four years, the air didn’t feel like it was choking Jamie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie sat in the backseat, knees pulled up to his chest, headphones on but playing nothing. He was sixteen now, though he felt a hundred years old inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last four years had been a blur of gray skies and a crushing, silent loneliness. Chicago had been unkind. Jamie hadn’t made friends—not really. He had spent four years feeling like he was wearing a costume that didn’t fit, his skin itching with a wrongness he didn’t have the vocabulary to name yet. He had grown his hair out, hiding behind the brown, wavy curtain that now brushed his shoulders, and he had gotten thinner, retreating into oversized hoodies to hide a body that felt like a mistake.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He stared out the window as his dad parked the car. The house looked exactly the same. The lawn was green. The sprinkler system was ticking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And right next door, the Vance house stood pristine and white.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie’s stomach twisted. &lt;i&gt;Four years.&lt;/i&gt; That was an eternity in high school time. They had been twelve when they left—children. Now they were juniors. Lena was probably different. His mom had told him Lena was “doing so well,” that she was captain of the cheer squad already, that she was beloved by the whole school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She definitely has new friends,&lt;/i&gt; Jamie thought, a dark weight settling in his chest. &lt;i&gt;She probably has a boyfriend. She probably doesn’t want the weird, sad kid from next door clinging to her anymore.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re here, kiddo,” his dad said, killing the engine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie took a shaky breath. He opened the car door and stepped out onto the driveway. He looked down at his shoes, Converse scuffed from pacing the floors of his bedroom in Chicago. He adjusted his hoodie, pulling the sleeves over his hands, trying to make himself smaller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he heard the sound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the sound of a screen door being thrown open with enough force to bounce off the exterior wall. &lt;i&gt;Thwack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie looked up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across the lawn, Lena Vance was standing on her porch. She was barefoot. She was wearing denim shorts and a simple tank top, her blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail that bobbed with her energy. She looked… radiant. Like she was made of the California sun itself. She was beautiful in a way that made Jamie’s chest ache, intimidated and awestruck all at once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She didn’t wave. She didn’t smile politely. She didn’t wait for her parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“JAMIE!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scream was raw, cracking in the middle. Lena leaped off the porch steps, skipping the walkway entirely and sprinting across the perfectly manicured grass separating their lawns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie froze. He barely had time to brace himself before 5′7″ of solid muscle and momentum collided with him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a hug; it was an impact. Lena hit him with the force of a freight train, her arms wrapping around his neck, nearly knocking them both onto the asphalt. Jamie staggered back, his hands instinctively coming up to catch her waist to keep them upright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re back,” she choked out, her face instantly buried in the crook of his neck. “You’re actually back.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She smelled like vanilla and something sharp, like ozone or static—a scent that was distinctly &lt;i&gt;Lena&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The breath rushed out of Jamie’s lungs, and with it, four years of tension. The “wrongness” that plagued him every day in Chicago didn’t vanish, but for the first time, it went quiet. The Lena-shaped hole in his heart, which had been bleeding a slow, miserable ache since he was twelve, suddenly plugged itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hi, Lele,” Jamie whispered, his voice cracking. He squeezed his eyes shut, burying his face in her shoulder, gripping the back of her shirt so hard his knuckles turned white.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They stood there in the driveway for a long time. The Hayes parents and the Vance parents were coming out now, exchanging greetings, laughing, pointing at the two teenagers locked in a death grip. But Lena didn’t let go. She was trembling. Jamie realized, with a shock, that she was crying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t you ever leave again,” she hissed into his neck, her voice wet and fierce. “I swear to God, Jamie, if you move again, I’m locking you up in the basement”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie let out a wet, shaky laugh. “Okay.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lena finally pulled back, just an inch, to look at him. Her hands came up to cup his face, squishing his cheeks. She scanned him intensely—taking in the longer hair, the delicate features, the sadness that was still lingering in his green eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You got pretty,” she stated, her tone matter-of-fact, though her eyes were red-rimmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie flushed, looking away. “I… I just grew my hair out. I can cut it if it’s—”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t you dare,” Lena interrupted, her thumbs brushing under his eyes, wiping away a tear he hadn’t realized had fallen. “I love it. You look like a prince.” She paused, then corrected herself with a soft, watery smile. “No. Like a princess. My princess.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was an old nickname, a private joke from when they were ten and Jamie had played the princess in a pretend tower. Hearing it now, used with such unironic affection, made Jamie’s knees weak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Come on,” Lena said, grabbing his hand. She didn’t ask if he wanted to say hi to his parents. She didn’t ask if he wanted to unpack. She just started dragging him toward her house. “You’re coming with me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My bags…” Jamie started feebly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Dad will get them!” Lena yelled over her shoulder without stopping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Vance, standing by the garage, just saluted. “I got it! Go on, you two!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lena dragged Jamie up the porch, through the cool, air-conditioned hallway of the Vance house—which smelled exactly like it used to, lemon polish and fresh linen—and up the stairs to her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She kicked the door shut behind them, closing out the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie looked around, expecting the pink, fluffy room of their childhood. He blinked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The room was still unmistakably Lena’s, but it had evolved. One wall was dominated by a desk that looked like the cockpit of a spaceship. A massive, sleek white PC tower hummed with soft blue LED lights. Three monitors were mounted on arms. A headset that looked expensive enough to buy a used car sat on a white mechanical keyboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You… you play now?” Jamie asked, bewildered, staring at the setup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“League of Legends,” Lena muttered, kicking off her shorts to change into sweatpants right in front of him, completely unbothered. “I needed to kill things. It helped with the stress.” She tossed Jamie a pair of her own gray sweatpants—they were oversized on her, which meant they’d fit him perfectly. “Put these on. Those jeans look uncomfortable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie obeyed, turning his back shyly to change. When he turned back around, Lena was already in her bed—a massive, plush thing piled high with pillows. She patted the empty space beside her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Get in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie climbed in. The sheets were cool and soft. He hesitated, lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. He felt stiff, the anxiety of the last few years still ghosting over his skin. &lt;i&gt;What do I do? Do we talk? Does she want to hear about Chicago?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He felt an arm snake around his waist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lena scooted close, pressing her chest against his back, her chin hooking over his shoulder. She pulled him flush against her, her leg hooking over his legs, trapping him. She effectively turned herself into a human shield, shielding him from the world, from Chicago, from everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I missed you so much it made me physically sick,” Lena whispered into his ear, her voice devoid of the confident, popular cheerleader tone she used outside. It was just Lena. “I tried to be nice to everyone, and I have all these ‘friends’ now, and they’re great, I guess… but god, Jamie. It was so lonely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie’s breath hitched. He turned his head slightly into the pillow, his hand coming up to hold the arm she had wrapped around him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have anyone,” Jamie admitted, his voice barely audible. “I just… I stayed in my room. I missed you every day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lena tightened her grip, pulling him closer if that was even possible. She buried her face in his hair, inhaling deeply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re fixing it,” she declared, her voice muffled by his hair. “We’re going to fix it. You’re staying here. We’re going to eat snacks, and I’m going to show you my kill-death ratio, which is frankly disgusting, and you’re going to sleep. You look like you haven’t slept in four years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I haven’t,” Jamie mumbled, his eyelids already feeling heavy. The safety of her warmth was acting like a sedative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sleep,” Lena commanded softly, pressing a kiss to the back of his neck. “I’ve got you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for the first time since 2010, Jamie Hayes closed his eyes and felt safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;No good deed goes unpunished. When I agreed to help my best friend fix her life with the aid of a wishing stone, I knew there might be potential magical ramifications. I just never thought they'd include me trading my lightsaber and gaming dice for ballet shoes and pom-poms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2107530-a-wish-unwanted/chapter/2107557/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Wish Unwanted – Part 1&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was attempting to finish prepping the last of my maps for an upcoming session of Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons when Cindy burst into my room looking like a cross between a lottery winner and the cat who ate the canary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Sam! Thank god you're not doing anything important!" she squealed, closing the door behind her. "I really need your help."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sighed and put the sharpie down, turning around in my chair to face her. Not that it was a really difficult task. Looking at Cindy Mueller was one of my all-time favorite things to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The gang is heading into the Cave of Woe to retrieve the Amulet of M'kran. I'd say that's pretty important."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She rolled her bright blue eyes and stuck out her tongue at me. "You know what I mean," she said. Her tone was jovial, but I noticed the way her gaze flickered over to the map on the desk behind me for a brief second. A longing, almost barely perceptible, appeared and vanished in a millisecond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You know," I said smiling, "if you wanted to join in ..."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She opened her mouth, then closed it as she shook her head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I've got ballet and cheer pretty much eating up my entire weekend. Thanks, though."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I merely nodded solemnly. "Of course." Lacing my fingers behind my head,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned my attention fully back to her. "Now, how may I be of assistance to the only cheerleader at Benson High who doesn't think getting within ten feet of me is cause for taking a shower?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her unblemished complexion reddened and a tiny frown creased her mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry, Sam. I'm trying to get them to stop picking on you."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I waved my hand dismissively. "No worries. It takes more than the malicious snipes of mean girls with more boobs than brains to get me down."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frown deepened and I mentally smacked myself in the head.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cindy, I didn't mean ..."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She shrugged, glancing away. "It's okay. You're not wrong in your assessment."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I was not including you in that grouping. You know that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another shrug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I wanted to throttle myself. Cindy and I had been friends for almost ten years. Since second grade. Like me, she'd been a nerdy outcast interested in anime, RPGs, and science-fiction. The two of us were like peas in a pod. Everyone else could say what they wanted about us, as&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;long as we had each other, they could all go take a flying leap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then the Puberty Fairy came to visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got six inches in height, with none of the girth to fill out my form. I went from a short, gangly dork to a tall, even ganglier dork with runaway acne and a scalp which could have applied for membership in OPEC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cindy, however, got it better. Or worse, if you asked her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She, too, gained inches. Not so much in height, but across the chest and hips. Her formerly stringy head of dirty blonde hair turned into waves of silky gold from the increased hormones. Her complexion, already decent, became pristine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was like the tale of the Ugly Duckling. Though I'd never considered Cindy ugly in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time we started our Freshman year, she was being drafted into all the popular cliques. Almost against her will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cheerleaders wanted her out helping them raise school spirit. The drama club wanted her to audition for every performance they were producing. And her own parents, mainly her father, pushed her to take ballet classes so she would have even more stuff to put on her college application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our time together dwindled to the occasional weekend movie get-together. She didn't have time for role-playing, or discussing the latest Star Trek movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how much she wanted it, her new obligations wouldn't allow her the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Seriously," I said. "I really wasn't talking about you."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I know, Sam. Still stung a bit, though."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry." Then I leaned forward, looking into her wide, blue eyes. "What do you need my help with?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This!" she said, pulling something out of her purse and holding it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It looked like an ordinary rock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least, it did at first. However, the longer I stared at it, the less "ordinary" it became. It was a dark green color, like an emerald, and perfectly square, around four or five inches on each side. The front of it had some type of carving on it. It resembled a woman's face in a way, though I thought the expression presented there was one of disgust.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cindy held the stone out toward me, urging me to look closer at it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every molecule in my body wanted to recoil from the thing. No matter how irrational it might seem to be afraid of a simple piece of carved gemstone. That rock was bad news. I could just feel it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What is it?" I asked, finally prying my gaze away from the disturbing thing. "Where did you get it?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's a Wish Stone," she said. Again, she bounced up and down on her toes with excitement. Causing other parts of her to bounce as well. "It grants wishes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I blinked, daring to look at the ugly object in her grip again. This time, the face seemed to be a little less malicious. Rather than disdain, I saw impatience. It still made my skin creep, but not quite as badly as before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A Wish Stone?" I asked, giving her the same skeptical eyebrow raise we both used to do to imitate our favorite Vulcan. "Seriously?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shrugged in that way that people do when they know they are right, but can't explain to you why they're right. A sort of "what can you do?" gesture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It was in my ballet bag. I found it this afternoon when I got home."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Who put it in there?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No clue. But if I knew, I would thank them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I leaned back, shaking my head. "If you don't know who gave it to you, how do you know what it is?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She winked playfully at me, and turned the stone around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The back side of it was smooth and flawless. Someone had taped a piece of paper to the surface. Slightly slanted black print flowed across it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is the Stone of Invidia. It will grant a single wish to you and another. Use it with someone you trust, for each of you will be wishing for the other."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I snorted, drawing an annoyed look from Cindy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You don't believe it?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pointed at the rock in her hand. "A magical stone that grants a single wish? No, I don't believe it." I shook my head. "Come on, Cin. Don't tell me you actually think that thing is real? Someone is pulling a joke on you." I snorted and shook my head. "You used to be smarter than that."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cloud of anger instantly descended across her pretty face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oh, so now I'm stupid? Is that what you think?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat up, waving my hands in defense. One of these days, I was going to let my brain get fully engaged before opening my mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No. I just mean ... come on. Wishing? Magic?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She planted a hand on one curvy hip and pointed at the desk behind me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One would think you'd have a more open mind about these things. With all the fantasy crap you enjoy."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sighed. This was the problem our friendship had suffered over the past three years. Every time we got together, I started to feel inadequate. Like a filthy peasant standing before a noblewoman. Which wasn't helped by the fact I'd been in love with Cindy since the fifth grade, but never behaved as more than just her pal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that she was out of my league, it was hard not to be resentful of my own shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You used to like this crap, too, you know."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A small pout formed on her face. "I still do. I miss it. I miss being goofy and hanging out all day on Saturday, eating pizza and doing dungeon crawls." She held up the stone. "This can help me get that back."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You don't need a wishing stone to do what you want, Cin. It's your life."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She looked away. "It's not that easy. I can't just walk away from everything."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Sure you can," I said. "Just tell those skanks you don't want to be a cheerleader anymore. Quit spending your free time in activities you hate. With people you hate." I shrugged. "See? Easy peasy."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The look she gave me screamed just how ignorant she thought I was about the matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Everyone looks at me and expects ... things. For me to act a certain way. Like specific things. Behave according to the way they believe I should behave. I've tried to fight against it, Sam. It's like fighting a force of nature. Just easier to go along." She glanced away and sighed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Is it really that bad?" I asked, trying not to sound too disbelieving. If she was really unhappy with the path her life had taken, she sure never showed it before. Not at school. Not with me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Did you know I signed up to take AP Physics at the beginning of the year? Mister H. denied my request on the grounds that it was too risky."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Douglas Hauser was Benson High's academic guidance counselor. It was his job to make sure that the students were happy, well-adjusted, and prepared for their futures. He was also a Class-A douchenozzle whose sensibilities were stuck back in 1985.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Why would you taking AP Physics be risky?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Because he thinks it will hurt my chances of getting into college if I flunk. Never mind the fact that I won three science fairs in a row back in middle school."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't know."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Originally, I thought she'd opted to not take the advanced class with me because she would rather hang out with her new besties. To hear otherwise made me feel guilty for being angry with her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I'm supposed to focus on cheering and doing things that are more social than academic. Mister H would only approve the most basic level of subjects for me. So, rather than learning about quantum mechanics and advanced number theory, I'm in beginner's chemistry and rudimentary algebra."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was speechless. Cindy was almost as smart as me. Maybe smarter in some areas. I couldn't imagine what torture it must be to sit in a boring lecture day after day with dummies who could barely follow the material. It'd be enough for me to claw my eyes out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What about your folks? Couldn't they talk to Mister H. for you?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I tried that already. My dad just ended up agreeing with him." She held up the stone again. "This is my one chance to change it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head, not wanting to look at the eerie block again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Even if it was real, Cin, you know how these things go. Magic wishes always come with hidden strings and pitfalls. How do you know you won't make it worse?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Nothing could be worse than not being in control of your own life, Sammy."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth, but realized I couldn't really argue against her point. Sure, my life wasn't a bed of roses by any stretch of the imagination. However, I could do what I want, when I wanted, and with whomever I wanted. The few friends I still had didn't care one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I don't know," I said, finally looking back at the rock in her hand. "I still think this is a bad idea."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had to admit, there was something about the thing that led me to accept, at least partially, that maybe it did have some type of power. The uneasiness that had washed over me the first time I saw it was still there, but had lessened to a degree that didn't seem possible. Was it making me more amicable to the idea of using it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You've got it lucky," she said, pulling my attention back to her. "Just being a guy by itself opens a lot of doors us girls have very little hope of opening. It's really not fair at all."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I waved my hands dismissively. How could Cindy possibly be jealous of me? Surely she remembered I was a lanky, glasses-wearing dork with a face which looked like I'd been bobbing for French fries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It's not all that and a bag of chips, you know. Being a guy isn't like some cakewalk. We have our own issues to deal with."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I never said it was a cakewalk, Sam. Just that it was easier than being a girl." She walked over to stand right next to me. "That's what I want you to wish for me. To let me have more control over my life. Like guys do. I want to be free from all the bullshit pressure and societal&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;obstacles that come with this." She gestured at her body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I glanced over at the stone. Now that it was closer, I realized there as a glow emanating from inside. Not extremely bright, but noticeable. Was there something inside it? Waiting for us to voice our desires? If so, it was a fair bet it wasn't a friendly entity. The smart thing would be&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;to throw the stone into the middle of the ocean and forget it ever existed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sighing, I looked away from the stone and up at Cindy with the intention of appealing once more to her common sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the wide, pleading eyes she stared at me with snapped my resolve like a tree in a hurricane. Even if we had drifted apart some over the past few years, she was my best friend in the whole world. If it was truly possible, didn't I owe it to our friendship to give her what she wanted?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also couldn't silence the voice that perked up to whisper that a Cindy who was no longer beholden to her circle of shallow friends would probably be more agreeable to spending time with me. Something I couldn't think of as a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Fine," I said with a sigh. "You win. I'll do it."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pouty look vanished in a second, replaced by a huge grin of happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Thank you, Sam!" she squealed. For a second, I honestly thought she was going to jump and down with giddiness. "You are the best friend ever!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shrugged, then turned to look the stone. Better to get this over with before the rational part of my brain talked me out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I wish," I began, the words sending a chill up my spine the moment they passed between my lips. It was like being at the top of a rollercoaster. That sensation you get in the pit of your stomach when the car you're in crests the apex of the climb. In that moment before gravity snatches you and drags you down into the abyss, you realize you've crossed the point&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;of no return.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I wish Cindy..."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Wait!" she said, quickly placing her finger over my lips. "Better use my full name. Just to be safe."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started to protest that any magic that could rewrite reality should be competent enough to understand to whom I was referring. However, I merely nodded and began again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I wish Cynthia Joan Mueller had a life that was as free from pressure as mine."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Out of my periphery, I could see Cindy practically bouncing out of her Nikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Granted!" came a voice from front of the stone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I turned back to Cindy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"There you go," I said with a playful tease in my voice. "One future free from the terrible burden of being a hot, popular girl. Have fun spending your Saturday nights studying with us nerds."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes narrowed as her lips pressed together in anger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"That was mean," she said in a voice that sounded too much like one of her stuck-up cheer buddies. "And I haven't given up my social life, Sam. Just broadened my future possibilities."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was taken aback at her reaction to my jest. "Whatever. At least you're happy now."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She arched a brow. "What about you? Don't you want your wish?"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I looked at the stone, then turned around in my chair, returning to the nearly completed map. "No thanks, I'm good."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cindy grabbed the back of the chair with her free hand and spun it back around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We both have to have a wish, Sam. Or else it doesn't work."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head. "I don't want a wish, Cindy. I like my life as it is. Just take your rock and go."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The transaction is not complete," the stone said. "The other party must declare."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What?" Cindy and I said in unison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stone, however, didn't repeat itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cindy turned to look up at me. "Looks like you don't get a choice, Sammy," she said as a smirk formed on her face. "I can't get what I want until I give you something you want."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I told you that I don't want anything."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She gave me a skeptical look. "That's bullshit. Tell me what you want, and I'll wish it for you." Her eyes drifted down to my lap. "How about a larger penis? Guys always wish theirs was bigger."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I quickly cupped my hands over my junk. "Stop that!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was instantly struck by the fear that she would utter the words, and I'd wake up tomorrow with a two-foot long schlong. Or one that reached the ground. I didn't trust the wishing stone one bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She pouted again. "Stop being such a scared pussy, Sam. Tell me what you want so I can wish it. I can't get mine until you get yours."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"No thanks. I'm not so shallow that I need magic to make my life better."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as I said the words, I regretted them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Shallow? You think I'm shallow??"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cindy, look ..."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I can't believe you! You know the shit I've had to put up with since puberty reared its ugly head. The leers, the stares, the rumors flying around like crazy. I smile at a guy, and he starts thinking about how to get in my pants. I try to excel in academics, and people tell me I'm too&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;pretty to worry about something as base as learning. I constantly have people pushing me to doing certain things and acting a certain way just because of how I look. Nobody sees the me beneath this body. I mean, I thought you did, but you're as bad as the rest of them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head and stood up, practically leaning over her. A wave of anger I couldn't explain rolled over me in a way I couldn't begin to fathom, making my heart race and my head begin to hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cry me a river, Prom Queen? You want to talk about annoying things that never stop? How about your bitching. I've known you for over ten years, and for the last four of them, you've done nothing but complain about how things have changed for you. Guess what? We all go through changes. However, most of us don't get the blessings you got. Yet, we learn to accept that and move on."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her mouth dropped open in shock at my outburst. However, the pounding in my head spurred me on before she could formulate a retort. It was as if my something inside me had broken open, preventing me from holding back from speaking my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Of course, you don't mind using your 'horrible' lot in life when it suits you, though. You complain that people don't look past your appearance, but then you jump right in and count yourself among them. If you had any real conviction, you would stand up to your so-called&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;friends. Especially when they're dumping on someone who is supposed to be your best friend!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her eyes hardened in a way I hadn't seen them do since the day in fourth grade when I accidentally broke her favorite pencil. She was past angry at my outburst. She was furious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I can't believe you, Sam. You're passing judgement on a situation you have no clue about. You've never been popular in your life. You don't understand the pressure I have to deal with. What I have to put up with on a daily basis."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I threw my hands in the air, my exasperation with her pushing rational thought aside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Well, excuse me. I'm sorry that I can't understand what it's like to be a beautiful girl who's wanted by everyone."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She narrowed her eyes as she stuck out her chin. "Well, I wish you did understand what it's like."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Granted!" the stone exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cindy's eyes widened. I felt mine do the same. We both looked at the stone in her hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The transaction is complete!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**********************************************************&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You better get up," a voice that sounded very much like my mother's called to me through the darkness. "You're going to be late!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I swam up toward the waking world, I tried to recall the horrible nightmare which had dogged my sleep. Cindy had wanted me to do something for her. Something I was reluctant to do. The more I focused, the more my memories came flooding back. Bit by bit until the very last thing I&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;remembered slammed into my mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My eyes flew open as I sat up, gasping from shock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was in bed. Only, it wasn't my bed. Nor my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not exactly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stream of sunlight drifting in through the part in the curtains illuminated the scene before me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gone were the posters of Jedi and Sith battling for the fate of the universe. Absent were the multitudes of miniature figures ranging from half-elf barbarian to dwarfish cleric that used to line the shelves. The pile of dirty clothes resting in the corner, a constant staple at least five days a week, was absent. The desk against the far wall, under the window, was no longer cluttered with maps, dice, and monster manuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, the walls were adorned with blue and white pennants broadcasting spirited slogans such as "Go Tigers!" and "Benson High Football!" There was also a pair of framed posters hanging on another wall. One a photograph of the lower legs and feet of a ballerina standing on pointe. The other a marquis advertisement for the New York Ballet Company's production of “The Nutcracker”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shelves held small photographs surrounded by decorative frames. From my position on the bed, I couldn't see the people in the photos clearly. The white wicker hamper in the corner of the room, however, I could definitely make out. Particularly with the way the yellow sunflower&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;affixed to the front of it seemed to capture, and amplify, the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The desk was neatly organized and relatively clutter-free. Other than a laptop computer smaller than the one that was previously sat there, I spotted a couple of textbooks stacked next to a dark brown purse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sighed and flopped back on the bed, staring up at the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is exactly the thing I was worried about," I said aloud. Even though the words came out in a breathy alto, rather than my usually scratchy baritone, I didn't bother to act surprised. The very nanosecond the words were out of Cindy's mouth, I knew what my fate beheld.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah, I know. Every story where a guy changes into a girl has the obligatory scene of him freaking out as he checks, at least a dozen times, for his missing dick. From there, it's the wide-eyed and slack-jawed groping at his new breasts, followed by the tentative "I can't look" event with a mirror. That's when it finally dawns on him that he's no longer a member of Dudeville.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tres cliché.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I lifted one arm up for examination. The limb was almost as slender as is used to be, but possessed more definition, and a lot less hair. The ends of each of the thin fingers at the end of it were tipped with perfectly manicured nails painted a glossy peach shade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Well, isn't that so cute," I murmured in a mocking tone. "I hope I don't accidentally chip one doing girly stuff."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I remained where I was for another five minutes, listening to the sound of the robin outside my window. The song she sang seemed rather joyous, and I found myself daydreaming about finding a bottle of nail polish to throw at her. Once my homicidal tendency toward avians passed, I figured I should go ahead and take a full survey of the damages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tossing back the covers, I discovered I was the proud (well maybe not proud) owner of a pair of shapely and toned legs. They emerged from the bottom of a pair of pink silk sleep shorts and terminated in ten little digits, all sporting nails painted the same shade as my fingers. I&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;wiggled the toes, feeling a tiny twinge of pain from the big toe on the right foot. The area around the nail, I noticed, was a bit bruised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Probably from ballet. Considering the pictures on the wall, not to mention the complaints from Cin, it's a fair bet I was also a tutu-wearing leaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I climbed out of bed, instantly aware of the shifting of flesh around my torso. My hands almost flew up to grab at them, but I managed to refrain. Probably be plenty of time to grope myself later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was a full-length mirror attached to the front of the closet door. It'd been there before my friend's ill-spoken wish, but then it had been covered in a myriad of superhero and sci-fi stickers. Leaving only a tiny clear spot where I could look at my face, if I desired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This mirror had the same dimensions and identical wooden frame. However,  the only item blocking any portion of its reflective surface was a small photograph, like those you would get taken at a carnival photo booth, jammed in one of the upper corners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Moment of truth, Sammy," I said softly as I walked over to the mirror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I paused for a good while, staring at the person in the looking glass who stared back at me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She wasn't blonde, to which I was immediately grateful. Instead, silky strands of chestnut, parted in the middle, hung down in a cut that stopped just at the top of her shoulders and curled the slightest bit at the end. Her eyes were a strikingly rich green, and wider than I expected, giving her a look that was equal parts surprise and sultry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her pale lips were full, just the tiniest bit pouty. They sat pursed together beneath a nose that was a smidge wider than thin. Coupled with high cheekbones, a nearly perfect complexion, and a smooth rounded chin, the whole package was, to put it mildly, beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beneath the face, she had a body that was obviously accustomed to extensive exercise. Dressed in a white, V-neck half-tee, it was easy to see the curve of her biceps and the slightly ripped muscles of her abdomen. I turned slightly, causing the girl's midsection to twinkle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reaching down, my fingers brushed against a knob of chilly metal bisecting the skin of my navel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A belly ring? You've got to be kidding me. I swear, if I turn around and see a tramp stamp, I'm going to kill Cin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, then opened them to perform a cursory inspection on the two remaining areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I could have guessed, my new body was well-endowed. Not so much as to be worthy of a porn star, but definitely a noticeable size. The tightness of the tee showcased the mounds, and the perky nipples attempting to pierce the thin cotton. Figures that girl-me wouldn't sleep in a bra or anything decent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I shook my head and placed my hands over them, giving a slight squeeze.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yep, firm and squishy. Houston, we have boobage!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most of those stories, the guy immediately cops a feel and announces to himself that his new girlish form is a 36-C. Or some other random bra size. For myself, the only tits I'd had the luxury of touching, other than the ones currently hanging from my chest, belonged to Tracy Mallory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It had been a long evening of playing Pathfinder, filled with a little too much sexual innuendo and a lot too much Mike's Hard Lemonade. When the rest of the gang left, Tracy offered to help me clean up the mess. We chatted while picking up bits of trail mix and popcorn from the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;floor. Then, just as I was turning around from emptying the dustpan, she tackled me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The kisses were sloppy, full of inexperience and wanton lust. After seventeen years on planet Earth, I thought I was finally going to find out what real sex, rather than the fake porn channel stuff, was all about. However, when I dared to slip one of my hands up under her sweater to fondle one of her flabby breasts, she recoiled from my touch and slapped me across the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn't help the adorable smirk that appeared on my new face. I might not know what size I was, but I sure as hell knew my breasts felt a lot better under my hand than Tracy's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, I turned to the side to look at my ass. Considering the flair of my hips, I wasn't surprised to see I now had some junk in my trunk. The curve of my backside was generous without being too bubbly. And the way the sleep shorts clung to the cheeks simply served to draw additional attention to just how well-formed it really was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Well, I can't say I'm disappointed with what I see. Definitely a step up from a sweaty, pimple-faced dork."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, I never harbored any desire to be a female. Other than the occasional hormone-fueled daydream. I liked being a guy, with guy parts and guy thoughts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if a wish was going to make me get more in touch with my feminine side, I was able to find comfort in the fact that she was hot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"You're going to be late!" my mother called from downstairs again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I glanced over to check the time on the clock on the nightstand and suddenly froze in shock and confusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Darth Vader informed me that it was currently seven o'clock in the morning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"What the hell?" I breathed, unable to stop staring at the Dark Lord of the Sith's visage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same clock had been sitting on a completely different nightstand before Cindy made her wish. In fact, it had been the only source of timekeeping in my bedroom for the past six years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'd seen it on a shelf in a comic bookstore right before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Offhandedly, I mentioned to Cindy that I thought it would be super cool to wake up to Darth's mechanical breathing every morning. However, I'd already spent all my allowance on an entire stack of cross-title sagas and couldn't afford to get it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The day after Christmas, Cindy had handed me a gift-wrapped box. She'd grinned like a fiend as she watched me tear off the paper to reveal the front of the box holding the clock. Since her transformation into a lovely young woman with ever-decreasing time for her best friend, the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;clock always reminded me of who she used to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I spun around and closed in on the mirror. More precisely, to the photograph stuck in the corner of the frame. I pulled it free and looked at the quartet of black and white photos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy and girl, each of them attempting to outdo the other with goofy poses, were approximately twelve years old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boy had short, spiky hair that stood straight up in most places, and stuck out at weird angles in others. He was skinny in that way boys go through when their bodies are completely confused by the influx of unfamiliar adolescent chemicals. A pair of black-rimmed glasses set on the bridge of a square nose dotted with multiple clogged pores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girl had long, dark hair that hung down to the middle of her back. A set of braces crisscrossed a toothy smile in one of the snapshots. She, too, had a couple of pimples dotting her forehead and chin. However, they were nowhere near as populous as those on the boy. She was cute, but it was easy to see the beauty she would one day become lurking just beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same beauty being reflected in the mirror before me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The memory of posing for those pictures, or at least, the original set came back to me. The Summer Carnival that had taken place three weeks after the end of seventh grade. Cindy had practically dragged me into the booth, threatening me with an atomic wedgie if I didn't comply. The resistance I attempted to put up, as the Borg would say, was "futile".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it was over, I pretended as if the event had pained me down to my soul. I even demanded she destroy the evidence, lest it fall into enemy hands. She responded by tacking the photo strip to the corkboard in her room, promising to use it against me should I eventually become a&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;mad scientist bent on global domination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I flipped the strip over. On the back, in exquisite cursive script was an inscription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"P &amp;amp; C: 6/28."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I knew without a doubt the photos showed myself and Cindy, or the male equivalent of Cindy, but the initials were confusing me. Which of us was "P", and which "C"? I wanted to assume that Cindy's parents would have named their baby boy something that started with the same letter. But that logic required my parents to have named their little girl something that started with an "S". Possibly something as mundane as "Samantha".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that I really expected anything to make total sense. After all, I was currently living in a reality formed by a snappy, off-the-cuff wish made to a magic rock by my former best friend. For all I knew, I could be the "C".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caroline. Carrie. Charlene. Candace. Plenty of tolerable names there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paige. Phoebe. Piper. Prue. Okay, so maybe the stone hadn't actually turned me into a witch. But I knew for a fact magic was real, and I did have the body of a CW starlet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I stuck the photo back into its spot in the mirror's corner, then went over to the desk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Elementary, my dear Miss Watson," I said as I opened the purse and pulled out a black leather wallet. "If you want to know who you are, you should start with checking your identification."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unsnapping the clasp on the wallet, I flipped through more than a half-dozen credit cards before I found what I was looking for. A driver's license. I pulled it free from the frosted plastic pouch and held it up before me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My jaw dropped in disbelief at the same time my mother yelled upstairs for the third time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Penelope Jean Davenport, get your butt down here right now!"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Penelope????&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana is writing a paper on portals, lucky enough, one opened in her fireplace. Yet this one is different from your usual, simple, short-ranged portal. Where to - and to whom - does this one lead?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scribblehub.com/read/2106359-home-for-christmas/chapter/2106360/"&gt;&lt;div class="chapter-title"&gt;Home for Christmas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="chp_raw" id="chp_raw"&gt;&lt;p align="justify"&gt;The grandfather clock under the stairs chimed seven times, deep, echoing gongs resonating through the house. It was quite dark outside, and the lampposts on the street threw shards of light through the windows and on her face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana woke up, trying to find her arm in the twist of her own body and the blanket that wrapped her. There it was, fully asleep and ready to tingle as soon as she released it from the clenched fist of the couch and her leg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She felt groggy, her power nap turned to a full four hours of sleep. September did that, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;A car drove past her house and its moving headlights illuminated Dana’s living room from side to side. The large – and mostly unused – dining table was covered in notepads, loose sheets of paper, pens, mugs and thick, old-looking volumes of magical physics; it had been two months since she had started writing her thesis and she had to admit to herself that maybe, just maybe, she had bitten off a bit more than she could chew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The little swirling hole of purple energy the size of a coffee mug that peeped from the wall in her fireplace had proved to be of a stranger nature than the usual portals that people talked about. Usually, you would find a tiny, new portal somewhere in your home and you’d find out it took you two blocks over to your neighbour who watches tv too loudly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;That had happened to her friend Eric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;And when she’d found her own little portal, she had been so excited. The perfect theme for a simple, textbook thesis. Study the portal, its destination, the parameters of transfer, note down the vathoparadigms and chronotype and &lt;i&gt;poof!&lt;/i&gt;, she’d have her work done in no time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Alas, no, there had been no neighbour who had reported a portal and at this point, it was clear that its twin was nowhere near Dana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Two months of wrapping her head around a mystery too hard to solve without a bit more than minimal effort, but she was too stubborn to look into something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Alright,” she said to herself. “Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She turned the floor lamp that she had moved from the corner to the fireplace, a long extension cord spooled to achieve that. She sat down on the floor, crossing her legs, picking her notes and grabbing the thin, metal chain that was tied to the low table behind her and whose other end was somewhere else in the universe. Dana hoped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She started pulling the chain, slowly, to avoid breaking it, even though she had cast a resistance spell on it before sending it off. With any luck, the Dee Navigational Probe she had borrowed from her University would show some results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;So far, the only thing she had gained from all of this was a flower. It took weeks of searching to find a match on it. It was a species native - and exclusive - to a northern mountain range several continents away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She stopped pulling the chain for a second, lost in thought. Her voice had gotten deeper, a change she had gladly welcomed. It was a thing she had always wanted, she found it ‘sounded more like her’. She also felt that her body had gotten more – angular? Not that she minded. In fact, when she looked at the mirror, it looked nice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She pulled the chain again and the little white marker on it told her that she was getting close to the probe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oi!” a distant voice yapped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana looked around and found no one. Someone from the street maybe?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oi, you, with the thermometer-looking thingy.” It sounded closer now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana leaned forward, hands on the floor, perching on her elbows. “Who the –”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“You’ve been tossing your little machines and cutting my flowers for a while now. Could you stop?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I –” Dana felt her head spin. A destination! She was &lt;i&gt;this &lt;/i&gt;close to learning what she needed. “I’m sorry!” she said. “I thought this was in the wild? I was trying to gather data and I hadn’t received any response until now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Had she lost her correspondent?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I s’pose,” the voice said, “I’ll accept your apology –”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Thank you! Than–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt; you properly introduce yourself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana pushed herself upright, then leaned back down, excited like a puppy, and knocking down the lamp in the process. She put it back up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“D- Dana, I’m Dana,” she said, “I’m writing my Master’s on the congenerities between endostructures and apices in portal travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Silence again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“That uh, I’m sorry, I was overly specific, that means –”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“That you’re studying how portal shapes define their destinations. I get it, I have some knowledge of this field,” she said. “And how’s that going for you?” She seemed amused, but in an interested way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Well, you’ll be proud to know I made first contact!” Dana chuckled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Congratulations! This must be a thrilling experience,” the voice giggled in return. “I’m Amy, by the way. It’s nice to meet you Dan.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oh, it’s – it’s Dana,” Dana hesitated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I’m so sorry! I misheard you and –”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“And my voice is very deep, huh? Yeah, the portal’s been doing this – and some other trickery. I don’t mind to be honest, though” Dana shrugged and then realised Amy could not see her do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oh,” Amy said, “I uhm – I know how that feels.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oh?” Dana accidentally mimicked, in response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“It seems that the portal does that. But if I’m being honest, I’m happy it’s happened. Or, well, it’s &lt;i&gt;happening&lt;/i&gt;. It’s not like you can pick this kind of thing up at the grocery store, if you know what I mean.” Amy paused for a minute, during which Dana just patiently waited. She felt a knot in her stomach, some part of what the mysterious woman from the portal was saying felt… familiar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Anyhow!” she snapped them both back to reality, “I can’t stay much longer, I have chores to tend to. But if you need information on my side, we could meet later?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana straightened herself up and remembered that she was, after all, supposed to gather data and write a thesis. “Yes! Absolutely, that sounds wonderful. When would be ok for you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I’m not sure what time it is over there, let’s say in –” Amy stretched the last word, “In seven hours? I’ll be sure to be done by then.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“That’s uh, pretty late here. Two am. But I can set an alarm.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Jeepers, that’s late! We can do this later, you don’t want to mess up your sleep schedule.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana glanced at the blanket on the couch and the pillows on the floor. “No, that’s ok. Promise.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Ok then,” Amy chirped, “It’s a date.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;It was October, the street was carpeted with red and orange leaves, the sky was gloomy and the pitter patter of the rain added music like the electrified air added effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;At six in the morning, Dana sat on a pillow on the floor, with a mug and a teapot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“What did you choose this time? It smells delicious.” Amy said. The portal had grown a bit larger and had gone from walnut-sized to CD-sized.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“It’s called Apple Pie Oolong, it has pecan and, well, apple.” Dana waited for Amy’s hand to cross the portal with an empty mug of her own and poured the tea in it. “Alright, you can go,” she told her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The hand disappeared and came back a few moments later with a handkerchief wrapped around something. “Here,” she said, cheerfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Thanks!” Dana picked the little bundle and opened it as Amy’s hand went through the purple circle again, leaving ripples in its centre. Five, perfectly round biscuits, still warm and with a delicious scent presented themselves to Dana, making her salivate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Holy cow, Amy! These look amazing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“They taste amazing too,” Amy giggled. “Thanks,” she added, her voice a bit shy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The three small pumpkins on the fireplace mantle stared down at Dana, uncarved but intense all the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Say, uhm, Amy –” she felt her voice choke in her throat. “Are you doing something for, uh – Halloween?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I was thinking pumpkin pie,” Amy said. “Why?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I thought we could, maybe, that we could spend it together? You know, since you’re isolated because of your research and I ehm, I – Well, I would like to spend it with you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;During their many meetings, they had gotten to know each other better. Amy had told Dana that she was working on an engineering research and had had to move all the way to this remote little corner in the mountains to conduct her experiments. Witches often did end up working by themselves. That, or in little groups of three.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Wasn’t that what we were going to do anyway?” Amy asked. “You were talking about Halloween so often I just assumed – Oh, I was wrong, wasn’t I?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“No! No, no, no, absolutely not, you were right, I hadn’t asked you but I wanted to.” Dana stammered and spluttered until she heard Amy laugh softly. “Oi, don’t make fun,” she complained, jokingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“You are adorable,” Amy said, still a smile clearly bending her lips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Shut up, you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“What are you going to dress up as? I’m planning to go as Sybil Leek.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I thought Flamel, maybe.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oh, fun. You’ll make a wonderful Nicolas, I’m sure.” Amy sounded excited&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana tried to reply but found that her voice had left her. After almost a minute of silence, Amy called to her. “Dana? Is everything alright?” When she hear Dana breathe louder, she stuck her arm through the portal once more and tapped the carpet, looking for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana took her hand and squeezed it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“I’m sorry,” she finally managed to say. “This is weird, I thought it would be fun to lean into my transition and dress up as a man, but –” she stopped again, words jumbled in her brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“But it feels a bit too real, and you’re scared,” Amy suggested softly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Dana squeezed her hand. “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“It’s not weird, sweetie. If someone can understand, it’s me. It was easier on me because I already knew who I was. But maybe you still have to figure that out. And I know it can be confusing, but I will help you. I’ll be here anytime you need.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Can I ask something of you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Of course.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Could – could you help me find a name?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Mid November was stormy and turbulent. Matthew was busier than ever and his professor kept on insisting that he expand his research to study the anomaly. He kept on reminding her that it would have taken him two years to study that and that he was happy to leave this job to anyone else, after he was done with his part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;It had been harder to meet with Amy, too. She had been called to the nearby village to deal with an outbreak of Crim Primarosa, nothing dangerous, but very time consuming. The little time she was left with, she had to dedicate to her research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;But she had kept her promise: whenever Matthew had had a question, a doubt, a fear, she would find a way to talk to him, to help him with what he was going through. Sometimes they managed to meet, sometimes they had to leave notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew sprinted from the bus stop to the front door of his house; the mere ten or eleven seconds it took him to cross the street were enough to get him completely drenched in the pouring rain. He fumbled in his wet pockets, looking for the keys with slippery fingers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Come on, come on,” he grunted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;He was late. Not by much, but lately, twenty minutes were enough to miss each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;As he got in, he kicked his shoes off without stopping and dropped his jacket on the floor, running to the centre of the living room and sliding into a halt with his socks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Amy!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;‘Oh’ he thought. There was a pouch on the floor, by the fireplace. He sat down and opened it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Matthew, I’m sorry I couldn’t be here today. A tree is threatening to fall on my roof because of the strong winds that have been bothering us lately. Blasted thing almost dropped a branch on my head this morning. I miss you and I hope that we can have our date soon. Mr Marigold has promised to teach me how to make a boar and berries stew and I can’t wait to try it out for you. I’m sure with this recipe I’ll beat your soup! (It was delicious, I dreamt about it on Wednesday.) I hope you’re taking care of yourself and I’ll be waiting to hear from you. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love, Amy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;&lt;i&gt;P.S. I hope you like my present.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew held the page to his chest and turned the pouch upside down. It dropped a tiny flask containing a glittery, blue powder and a thin label tied to it said “bath salts”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew sneezed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Maybe a warm bath after getting soaked like that was not such a bad idea. He walked upstairs and opened the faucet of his bathtub. He thought about Amy and wondered whether he should worry about the tree and her roof. He told himself there would be no need; she was strong and resourceful, but he couldn’t help but feel anxious to talk to her again and know she was alright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;When the tub was half full, he opened the flask and poured its contents in. The water immediately turned indigo, then it swirled into all shades of blue. The whole bathroom was flooded in sparkles and a sweet scent of violet pervaded the air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;It was such a pretty spell, Amy always knew how to make him feel better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;He got ready to dip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;His body was newer to him, almost everyday. He saw the effects of the portal and felt that somehow, it had known who he was before he did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;It was cold outside, the snow had started falling a week before and now all the roofs in the city were white. Matthew slept on the floor, wrapped in a blanket like a burrito. It was morning and a soft, clear light illuminated the room. Letters from Amy, the ones he had not carefully put away yet, lay on the floor around him, next to photographs of her, her garden, the apple pie she had baked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She looked beautiful, radiant, kind. Her long, wavy, blond hair framed her round face, her cheeks were pink and looked as soft as clouds and her green eyes pierced Matthew in the heart each time he looked at her picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew’s chest raised and lowered at a slow rhythm. His long eyelashes twitched every few breaths, when his dreams got more vivid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;He had fallen asleep after a long night of talking together, sharing dreams and wishes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;He had told her he wanted to spend Christmas together. It was the 24th of December and their plan was to have lunch together, by the fireplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;The portal had not changed its size anymore and besides passing each other treats and messages, and holding hands, they had not been able to use it to be closer to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew stirred when Amy’s voice called his name, tenderly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“G’morning,” he mumbled. He sat up and straightened his festive sweater.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Did you sleep well?” Amy asked?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Wonferfully,” he lied. The floor was not the most comfortable place in the house. “You?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Oh, I didn’t sleep,” she said. “I was too close to finishing my research.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“On Christmas?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Wanna see?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;He wobbled on the pillow, preparing to see something come out of the portal. “Yeah, of course!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Ok, ready!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;A weird tool peeped in through the purple circle. Matthew squinted but didn’t recognise it. It twirled and beeped, then dove right back where it had come from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Was that i–”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Before he could finish speaking, a wave of lilac light flashed through the whole room, the portal whooshed and in a second, it grew to cover the whole wall in the fireplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;A bushy, blond head appeared, followed by a pair of shoulders, and the rest of her stepped out, crouching to fit her tall figure through the magic circle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Amy held out her hand to Matthew, who stared up, incredulous, at the girl he’d fallen in love with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Merry Christmas,” she said, cheerfully. “Let’s go, lunch is ready.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;She held out her hand to him and he grabbed it, as she led him through, her hair flowing behind her like waves of gold that smelled like violets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew walked behind her, still stunned. His stomach felt warm, like when a cat lays on you and curls up to nap. As he crossed the swirling pool of magic, he felt electrified, but maybe it was because Amy was squeezing his hand. They slipped out of the portal and into a snowy garden, tall trees covered in ice, a small cottage just a little way away, white smoke puffing out of the chimney. The sky was pink, fading into the softest, lightest blue, and the air sparkled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;Matthew gently pulled Amy’s hand and spun her to look into her eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align="justify"&gt;“Merry Christmas indeed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island of New Lesbos is a lesbian paradise, which all girls-who-like-girls want to visit at least once in their life. A new year at the prestigious Sappho University is about to start, with a new cohort of students from around the world eager to find love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, however, they are joined by a boy and a girl who grew up in the island; Daisy, the Queen of Sappho, and Yuri, winner of the Sapphic Literature award.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will every girl get their happy ending? Or will there be losers at the musical chairs game of love, victims to the lesbian free-for-all?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is New Lesbos truly yuri paradise? Or is it truly yuri hell, beneath its carefully managed facade?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a romcom with a good dose of smut for good measure.&lt;br /&gt; There are multiple POV characters.&lt;br /&gt; The story explores multiple LGBTQ+ themes, even beyond lesbian romance, hopefully with the respect those themes deserve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something of a journal of the first two years of my transition. It mostly consists of me bouncing off one person and another and another on my way to becoming the world's first and only "transgender math princess."&lt;br /&gt; Every chapter is about somebody who had an impact on my transition. Some of them are friends, lovers, relatives. Others are people I meet once for a few minutes and never see again in my entire life. Some, I imagine, know that they had an impact on me. Most probably have no fucking idea.&lt;br /&gt; My hope is that publishing this will help me see the project through, especially if I know people are interested. Any bit of support is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiona would love for Brent to move out of his apartment and into hers, but her overprotective brother still lives with her, and he’d freak if he even knew she was dating someone. Brent wants her to tell her brother the truth: it’s time for him to move out so she can live with the man she loves. Instead Fiona panics and pretends a new girl in town wants to move in with her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brent already struggles with living up to the expectations of manhood, so when Fiona suggests using magic to turn him into a girl that her brother would approve of, he has no intention of going through with it. It isn’t until he sees himself in the mirror as a girl that “Tali” thinks the plan might actually work. And surely the butterflies in her stomach are just because of nerves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rituals of Flesh and Consciousness is a collection of intimate short stories that explore the fragile boundary between body and mind, desire and fear, presence and memory. Through quiet moments, restrained gestures, and unspoken emotions, the work examines how intimacy can become a ritual — not of excess, but of awareness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each narrative focuses on connection as an internal experience: the weight of a breath, the warmth of proximity, the silence shared between two bodies in a closed space. There is no spectacle, only perception. What unfolds is not merely closeness, but the realization of being seen without judgment, untouched by external eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book invites the reader to reflect on vulnerability as a form of strength, and on intimacy as an act of consciousness — a meeting where the body listens as much as it feels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a former student ranger and their partner, an Absol with the name of Eve, arrive in Kalos after two months of travel between regions, they are relieved to finally be safe. However, they are swiftly dragged into a complex story that is not their own, whether they like it or not.&lt;br /&gt; Some things are just hard to see until the second playthrough.&lt;br /&gt; ~&lt;br /&gt; This is a sequel/rewrite of my completed pokemon fanfic, The Ranger Reject, (which was the first thing I ever wrote), hopefully far more readable because of my increased experience and easier to access for more readers. You don’t need to read it first, or really at all, to get the full picture of this story, but it will serve as a sort of, let's say, alternate timeline of this.&lt;br /&gt; Also, I’m writing this entirely for fun, so don’t expect a very stable upload schedule, but I have a little fairy on my shoulder bugging me to write this so don’t worry, it’ll probably not stagnate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how during the pandemic of 2020, I was faced with the prospect of unemployment and turned to camming as a way of earning some money, but where would it lead to?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is a slow progression with a dense protagonist, lead mainly by seeking pleasure and the feedback of approval, (with plenty of smut and fairly graphic descriptions of sex acts) there are twists and setbacks as their online persona and life seeps into their offline existence, ultimately colliding as the world re-opens as Covid cases drop. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can they maintain a sense of self without getting lost down the warren? how deep will they go and where to they end up? only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Lehrer is looking forward to turning in his final paper for his Jewish History course, and getting to relax and celebrate Hannukah, when a terrifying encounter with a time traveler sends him back to a shtetl in 19th century Latvia; the very same one where his ancestors lived!  The time machine that sends him back is equipped with a cloaking device that allows the wearer to blend in wherever they go, but oy gevalt, it's calibrated for its original owner, who is a woman!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="wi_fic_desc" property="description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A butch trans girl signs up to provide her blood to a vampire in need. Surely this will remain an entirely platonic and nonsexual endevour.&lt;br /&gt; ---&lt;br /&gt; Hi everyone, this work will probably be reworked before it's completed, this is just something I want to play around with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description>
